Script to populate author names and addresses into bioRxiv.org submission system. 

* Fill all authors into the array at the beginning (I did this with a RegEx on a tab-delimited text file).

* Go to authors page in Chrome, set number of authors, open Developer Tools under the View menu. 

* Paste this script into the Console.

* Hit return.

* Click "Save/Continue" at bottom and check for errors (doesn't like special characters).
