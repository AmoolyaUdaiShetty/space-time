Analysis of EBOV genome sequence from Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia from 2014-2016

This project is a collaboration between the many groups that sequenced virus genomes during the 2014-2016 epidemic in West Africa. Most of the sequence data has been deposited in GenBank but this repository represents a comprehensive data set curated and annotated by the groups involved. The data is currently being analysed with the intent to publish a paper on the spatial and temporal dynamics inferred from virus genome sequences. The analyses and the methods and scripts that underly them will be posted to this repository in the spirit of Open Science and we welcome comments. We hope that early access to this data set and the downstream products such as time-calibrated trees and inferred spatial patterns will foster further research in this area.
