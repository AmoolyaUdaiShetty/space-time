	Abstract = {An epidemic of Ebola virus disease of unprecedented scale has been ongoing for more than a year in West Africa. As of 29 April 2015, there have been 26,277 reported total cases (of which 14,895 have been laboratory confirmed) resulting in 10,899 deaths. The source of the outbreak was traced to the prefecture of Gu{\'e}ck{\'e}dou in the forested region of southeastern Guinea. The virus later spread to the capital, Conakry, and to the neighbouring countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal and Mali. In March 2014, when the first cases were detected in Conakry, the Institut Pasteur of Dakar, Senegal, deployed a mobile laboratory in Donka hospital to provide diagnostic services to the greater Conakry urban area and other regions of Guinea. Through this process we sampled 85 Ebola viruses (EBOV) from patients infected from July to November 2014, and report their full genome sequences here. Phylogenetic analysis reveals the sustained transmission of three distinct viral lineages co-circulating in Guinea, including the urban setting of Conakry and its surroundings. One lineage is unique to Guinea and closely related to the earliest sampled viruses of the epidemic. A second lineage contains viruses probably reintroduced from neighbouring Sierra Leone on multiple occasions, while a third lineage later spread from Guinea to Mali. Each lineage is defined by multiple mutations, including non-synonymous changes in the virion protein 35 (VP35), glycoprotein (GP) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) proteins. The viral GP is characterized by a glycosylation site modification and mutations in the mucin-like domain that could modify the outer shape of the virion. These data illustrate the ongoing ability of EBOV to develop lineage-specific and potentially phenotypically important variation.},

	Abstract = {Author Summary
At least 15 million doses of anti-rabies post-exposure prophylaxis are administered annually worldwide, and an estimated 55,000 people die of rabies every year. Over 99\% of these deaths occur in developing countries, predominantly in Asia and in Africa where rabies is endemic in domestic dogs. Despite the global health burden due to rabies, little is known about the patterns of the spread of dog rabies in these endemic regions. We used recently developed Bayesian analytical methods to unravel the dynamics and determinants of the spatial diffusion of dog rabies viruses in North Africa based on viral genetic data. Our analysis reveals a combination of restricted spread across administrative borders, the occasional long-distance movement of rabies viruses, and a strong fit between spatial spread of the virus and road distances between localities. Together, these data indicate that by transporting dogs, humans have played a key role in the dispersal of a major animal pathogen. Our studies therefore provide essential new information on the transmission dynamics of rabies in Africa, and in doing so will greatly assist in future intervention strategies.},

	Abstract = {Although foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) incidence has decreased in South America over the last years, the pathogen still circulates in the region and the risk of re-emergence in previously FMDV-free areas is a veterinary public health concern. In this paper we merge environmental, epidemiological and genetic data to reconstruct spatiotemporal patterns and determinants of FMDV serotypes A and O dispersal in South America. Our dating analysis suggests that serotype A emerged in South America around 1930, while serotype O emerged around 1990. The rate of evolution for serotype A was significantly higher compared to serotype O. Phylogeographic inference identified two well-connected sub networks of viral flow, one including Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador; another including Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. The spread of serotype A was best described by geographic distances, while trade of live cattle was the predictor that best explained serotype O spread. Our findings show that the two serotypes have different underlying evolutionary and spatial dynamics and may pose different threats to control programmes. Key-words: Phylogeography, foot-and-mouth disease virus, South America, animal trade.},

	Abstract = {Author Summary  What explains the geographic dispersal of emerging pathogens? Reconstructions of evolutionary history from pathogen gene sequences offer qualitative descriptions of spatial spread, but current approaches are poorly equipped to formally test and quantify the contribution of different potential explanatory factors, such as human mobility and demography. Here, we use a novel phylogeographic method to evaluate multiple potential predictors of viral spread in human influenza dynamics. We identify air travel as the predominant driver of global influenza migration, whilst also revealing the contribution of other mobility processes at more local scales. We demonstrate the power of our inter-disciplinary approach by using it to predict the global pandemic expansion of H1N1 influenza in 2009. Our study highlights the importance of integrating evolutionary and ecological information when studying the dynamics of infectious disease.},

	Abstract = {SummaryBackground
Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are among those species most susceptible to the rapidly changing arctic climate, and their survival is of global concern. Despite this, little is known about polar bear species history. Future conservation strategies would significantly benefit from an understanding of basic evolutionary information, such as the timing and conditions of their initial divergence from brown bears (U. arctos) or their response to previous environmental change.
Results
We used a spatially explicit phylogeographic model to estimate the dynamics of 242 brown bear and polar bear matrilines sampled throughout the last 120,000 years and across their present and past geographic ranges. Our results show that the present distribution of these matrilines was shaped by a combination of regional stability and rapid, long-distance dispersal from ice-age refugia. In addition, hybridization between polar bears and brown bears may have occurred multiple times throughout the Late Pleistocene.
Conclusions
The reconstructed matrilineal history of brown and polar bears has two striking features. First, it is punctuated by dramatic and discrete climate-driven dispersal events. Second, opportunistic mating between these two species as their ranges overlapped has left a strong genetic imprint. In particular, a likely genetic exchange with extinct Irish brown bears forms the origin of the modern polar bear matriline. This suggests that interspecific hybridization not only may be more common than previously considered but may be a mechanism by which species deal with marginal habitats during periods of environmental deterioration.},

	Abstract = {Two escape mutants (R10c/1 and R10c/10) of the human respiratory syncytial (RS) virus Long strain were selected after serial passage in the presence of monoclonal antibody c793 directed against the G glycoprotein. This antibody recognizes an epitope which is shared by all viruses of the two antigenic subgroups in which human RS virus isolates have been subdivided. The mutant viruses had lost most of the G protein conserved and subgroup-specific epitopes but maintained the strain-variable epitopes. The two mutants had 10 or 11 nucleotide changes in the central region of the G protein gene when compared to the Long sequence, and almost all of those changes were different between the two mutants. The majority of the nucleotide changes involved A-G transitions (U-C in the positive sense) that resulted in amino acid substitutions. Each mutant had a total of six amino acid changes, and the changes were different between the two mutants. Unexpectedly, each mutant lost one of the four conserved cysteines of the G protein, and a different cysteine (Cys 182 or 186) was lost in each mutant. They are, in fact, the first reported RS viruses with only three cysteines in the G protein ectodomain. The genetic mechanism that generated the escape mutants and its relevance for the natural history of RS virus are discussed.},

One of these nucleotide substitutions and one deletion resulted in alteration of the reading frames of two fusion genes, as confirmed by in vitro translation of synthetic mRNAs. One cluster of mutations was exceptional; in the matrix gene of the MIBE case, 50\% of the U residues were changed to C, which might result from a highly biased copying event exclusively affecting this gene. We propose that the cluster of mutations in the MIBE case, and other combinations of mutations in other cases, favored propagation of MV infections in brain cells by conferring a selective advantage to the mutated genomes.},

	Abstract = {Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is a double-stranded RNA binding protein and RNA-editing enzyme that modifies cellular and viral RNAs, including coding and noncoding RNAs. This interferon (IFN)-induced protein was expected to have an antiviral role, but recent studies have demonstrated that it promotes the replication of many RNA viruses. The data from these experiments show that ADAR1 directly enhances replication of hepatitis delta virus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1, vesicular stomatitis virus, and measles virus. The proviral activity of ADAR1 occurs through two mechanisms: RNA editing and inhibition of RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR). While these pathways have been found independently, the two mechanisms can act in concert to increase viral replication and contribute to viral pathogenesis. This novel type of proviral regulation by an IFN-induced protein, combined with some antiviral effects of hyperediting, sheds new light on the importance of ADAR1 during viral infection and transforms our overall understanding of the innate immune response.},

	Abstract = {An activity that unwinds double-stranded RNA has been reported to exist in several organisms. We have analyzed the RNA intermediates and final products of the unwinding reaction. Although the RNA becomes sensitive to single strand-specific ribonucleases during the reaction, the duplex is never completely unwound. Furthermore, the base pairing properties of the RNA are permanently altered; the reacted RNA cannot rehybridize to form the original duplex. We demonstrate that during the reaction many, but not all, of the adenosine residues are converted to inosine residues, and we propose that the covalent modification is responsible for the irreversible change in base pairing properties. Possible biological roles for the unwinding/modifying activity, as well as its relevance to antisense RNA experiments, are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Previous experiments have shown that mRNA translation in frog oocytes can be inhibited by the injection of a complementary antisense RNA. Here we explore the use of antisense RNAs to study the functions of localized maternal mRNAs during postfertilization development. While developmental abnormalities were observed in injected fertilized eggs, these abnormalities could not be attributed to the antisense RNA since they were induced at a similar frequency in control embryos. Biochemical tests show that the injected antisense RNA does not form stable hybrids in vivo with its complementary endogenous mRNA. In addition, a novel activity that unwinds RNA:RNA duplexes was found. This activity exists at high levels in eggs and early embryos and is absent or very much diminished in oocytes and late blastula embryos. These results suggest that antisense RNAs may be of limited use in studying the functions of maternal RNAs in Xenopus.},

@article{quick_2016,
	Abstract = {The Ebola virus disease epidemic in West Africa is the largest on record, responsible for over 28,599 cases and more than 11,299 deaths. Genome sequencing in viral outbreaks is desirable to characterize the infectious agent and determine its evolutionary rate. Genome sequencing also allows the identification of signatures of host adaptation, identification and monitoring of diagnostic targets, and characterization of responses to vaccines and treatments. The Ebola virus (EBOV) genome substitution rate in the Makona strain has been estimated at between 0.87 × 10−3 and 1.42 × 10−3 mutations per site per year. This is equivalent to 16--27 mutations in each genome, meaning that sequences diverge rapidly enough to identify distinct sub-lineages during a prolonged epidemic. Genome sequencing provides a high-resolution view of pathogen evolution and is increasingly sought after for outbreak surveillance. Sequence data may be used to guide control measures, but only if the results are generated quickly enough to inform interventions. Genomic surveillance during the epidemic has been sporadic owing to a lack of local sequencing capacity coupled with practical difficulties transporting samples to remote sequencing facilities. To address this problem, here we devise a genomic surveillance system that utilizes a novel nanopore DNA sequencing instrument. In April 2015 this system was transported in standard airline luggage to Guinea and used for real-time genomic surveillance of the ongoing epidemic. We present sequence data and analysis of 142 EBOV samples collected during the period March to October 2015. We were able to generate results less than 24 h after receiving an Ebola-positive sample, with the sequencing process taking as little as 15--60 min. We show that real-time genomic surveillance is possible in resource-limited settings and can be established rapidly to monitor outbreaks.},

Twenty-five EBOV genomes were sequenced at the Liberian Institute for Biomedical Research, which provided an in-depth view of EBOV diversity in Liberia during September 2014-February 2015. These sequences were consistent with a single virus introduction to Liberia; however, shared ancestry with isolates from Mali indicated at least 1 additional instance of movement into or out of Liberia. The pace of change is generally consistent with previous estimates of mutation rate. We observed 23 nonsynonymous mutations and 1 nonsense mutation. Six of these changes are within known binding sites for sequence-based EBOV medical countermeasures; however, the diagnostic and therapeutic impact of EBOV evolution within Liberia appears to be low.},

@article{volz_2014,
	Abstract = {Background: The Ebola virus (EBOV) epidemic in Western Africa is the largest in recorded history and control efforts have so far failed to stem the rapid growth in the number of infections. Mathematical models serve a key role in estimating epidemic growth rates and the reproduction number (R0) from surveillance data and, recently, molecular sequence data. Phylodynamic analysis of existing EBOV time-stamped sequence data may provide independent estimates of the unobserved number of infections, reveal recent epidemiological history, and provide insight into selective pressures acting upon viral genes.
Methods: We fit a series mathematical models of infectious disease dynamics to phylogenies estimated from 78 whole EBOV genomes collected from distinct patients in May and June of 2014 in Sierra Leone, and perform evolutionary analysis on these genomes combined with closely related EBOV genomes from previous outbreaks. Two analyses are conducted with values of the latent period that have been used in recent modelling efforts. We also examined the EBOV sequences for evidence of possible episodic adaptive molecular evolution during the 2014 outbreak.
Results: We find evidence for adaptive evolution affecting L and GP protein coding regions of the EBOV genome, which is unlikely to bias molecular clock and phylodynamic analyses. We estimate R0=2.40 (95\% HPD:1.54-3.87 ) if the mean latent period is 5.3 days, and R0=3.81, (95\% HPD:2.47-6.3) if the mean latent period is 12.7 days. The estimated coefficient of variation (CV) of the number of transmissions per infected host is very high, and a large proportion of infections yield no transmissions.
Conclusions: Estimates of R0 are sensitive to the unknown latent infectious period which can not be reliably estimated from genetic data alone. EBOV phylogenies show significant evidence for superspreading and extreme variance in the number of transmissions per infected individual during the early epidemic in Sierra Leone.},

@article{stadler_2014,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND METHODOLOGY: The current Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa has been spreading at least since December 2013. The first confirmed case of Ebola virus in Sierra Leone was identified on May 25. Based on viral genetic sequencing data from 72 individuals in Sierra Leone collected between the end of May and mid June, we utilize a range of phylodynamic methods to estimate the basic reproductive number (R0). We additionally estimate the expected lengths of the incubation and infectious periods of the virus. Finally, we use phylogenetic trees to examine the role played by population structure in the epidemic.
RESULTS: The median estimates of R0 based on sequencing data alone range between 1.65-2.18, with the most plausible model yielding a median R0 of 2.18 (95\% HPD 1.24-3.55). Importantly, our results indicate that, at least until mid June, relief efforts in Sierra Leone were ineffective at lowering the effective reproductive number of the virus. We estimate the expected length of the infectious period to be 2.58 days (median; 95\% HPD 1.24-6.98). The dataset appears to be too small in order to estimate the incubation period with high certainty (median expected incubation period 4.92 days; 95\% HPD 2.11-23.20). While our estimates of the duration of infection tend to be smaller than previously reported, phylodynamic analyses support a previous estimate that 70\% of cases were observed and included in the present dataset. The dataset is too small to show a particular population structure with high significance, however our preliminary analyses suggest that half the population is spreading the virus with an R0 well above 2, while the other half of the population is spreading with an R0 below 1.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall we show that sequencing data can robustly infer key epidemiological parameters. Such estimates inform public health officials and help to coordinate effective public health efforts. Thus having more sequencing data available for the ongoing Ebola virus epidemic and at the start of new outbreaks will foster a quick understanding of the dynamics of the pathogen.},

	Abstract = {The ratio of non-synonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) changes between taxa is frequently computed to assay the strength and direction of selection. Here we note that for comparisons between closely related strains and/or species a second parameter needs to be considered, namely the time since divergence of the two sequences under scrutiny. We demonstrate that a simple time lag model provides a general, parsimonious explanation of the extensive variation in the dN/dS ratio seen when comparing closely related bacterial genomes. We explore this model through simulation and comparative genomics, and suggest a role for hitch-hiking in the accumulation of non-synonymous mutations. We also note taxon-specific differences in the change of dN/dS over time, which may indicate variation in selection, or in population genetics parameters such as population size or the rate of recombination. The effect of comparing intra-species polymorphism and inter-species substitution, and the problems associated with these concepts for asexual prokaryotes, are also discussed. We conclude that, because of the critical effect of time since divergence, inter-taxa comparisons are only possible by comparing trajectories of dN/dS over time and it is not valid to compare taxa on the basis of single time points.},

	Abstract = {A new member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, influenza D virus (IDV), was first reported in swine in the Midwest region of the United States. This study aims to extend our knowledge on the IDV epidemiology and to determine the impact of bovine production systems on virus spread. A total of 15 isolates were recovered from surveillance of bovine herds in Mississippi, and two genetic clades of viruses co-circulated in the same herd. Serologic assessment from neonatal beef cattle showed 94\% seropositive, and presumed maternal antibody levels were substantially lower in animals over six months of age. Active IDV transmission was shown to occur at locations where young, weaned, and comingled calves were maintained. Serological characterization of archived sera suggested that IDV has been circulating in the Mississippi cattle populations since at least 2004. Continuous surveillance is needed to monitor the evolution and epidemiology of IDV in the bovine population.},

	Abstract = {Restriction site and insertion/deletion polymorphism in a 45-kb region of the white locus on the X chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster was investigated for 64 X chromosome lines with six 6-cutter and ten 4-cutter restriction enzymes. A total of 109 polymorphisms were detected (54 restriction sites and 55 insertions/deletions). Estimated heterozygosity per nucleotide for this region (0.004-0.008) was similar to those of the Adh and 87A heat-shock locus regions located on the autosomes in D. melanogaster. This is contrary to a simple prediction based on the theory of mutation selection-balance of partially recessive deleterious mutants which predicts less variation on X chromosomes. Large linkage disequilibria between pairs of polymorphisms (including insertions and deletions) within the transcriptional unit (especially the 3' end of the 1st intron) were observed. As expected from population genetics theory, linkage disequilibria between these polymorphisms were greater for those pairs that are physically closer on the restriction map. Linkage equilibrium was typically observed when the pairs of sites were separated by 2 kb or more. Although significant between-line variation in eye pigment was observed (P less than 0.05), there is little evidence for strong associations between this phenotype and the polymorphisms at the DNA level.},

	Abstract = {Statistical tests for detecting mosaic structure or recombination among nucleotide sequences usually rely on identifying a pattern or a signal that would be unlikely to appear under clonal reproduction. Dozens of such tests have been described, but many are hampered by long running times, confounding of selection and recombination, and/or inability to isolate the mosaic-producing event. We introduce a test that is exact, nonparametric, rapidly computable, free of the infinite-sites assumption, able to distinguish between recombination and variation in mutation/fixation rates, and able to identify the breakpoints and sequences involved in the mosaic-producing event. Our test considers three sequences at a time: two parent sequences that may have recombined, with one or two breakpoints, to form the third sequence (the child sequence). Excess similarity of the child sequence to a candidate recombinant of the parents is a sign of recombination; we take the maximum value of this excess similarity as our test statistic Δm,n,b. We present a method for rapidly calculating the distribution of Δm,n,b and demonstrate that it has comparable power to and a much improved running time over previous methods, especially in detecting recombination in large data sets.},

	Abstract = {Recombination is a powerful evolutionary force that merges historically distinct genotypes. But the extent of recombination within many organisms is unknown, and even determining its presence within a set of homologous sequences is a difficult question. Here we develop a new statistic, Φw, that can be used to test for recombination. We show through simulation that our test can discriminate effectively between the presence and absence of recombination, even in diverse situations such as exponential growth (star-like topologies) and patterns of substitution rate correlation. A number of other tests, Max χ2, NSS, a coalescent-based likelihood permutation test (from LDHat), and correlation of linkage disequilibrium (both r2 and {\textbar}D′{\textbar}) with distance, all tend to underestimate the presence of recombination under strong population growth. Moreover, both Max χ2 and NSS falsely infer the presence of recombination under a simple model of mutation rate correlation. Results on empirical data show that our test can be used to detect recombination between closely as well as distantly related samples, regardless of the suspected rate of recombination. The results suggest that Φw is one of the best approaches to distinguish recurrent mutation from recombination in a wide variety of circumstances.},

@article{boni_2010,
	Abstract = {The rapid evolution of influenza viruses occurs both clonally and non-clonally through a variety of genetic mechanisms and selection pressures. The non-clonal evolution of influenza viruses comprises relatively frequent reassortment among gene segments and a more rarely reported process of non-homologous RNA recombination. Homologous RNA recombination within segments has been proposed as a third such mechanism, but to date the evidence for the existence of this process among influenza viruses has been both weak and controversial. As homologous recombination has not yet been demonstrated in the laboratory, supporting evidence, if it exists, may come primarily from patterns of phylogenetic incongruence observed in gene sequence data. Here, we review the necessary criteria related to laboratory procedures and sample handling, bioinformatic analysis, and the known ecology and evolution of influenza viruses that need to be met in order to confirm that a homologous recombination event occurred in the history of a set of sequences. To determine if these criteria have an effect on recombination analysis, we gathered 8307 publicly available full-length sequences of influenza A segments and divided them into those that were sequenced via the National Institutes of Health Influenza Genome Sequencing Project (IGSP) and those that were not. As sample handling and sequencing are executed to a very high standard in the IGSP, these sequences should be less likely to be exposed to contamination by other samples or by laboratory strains, and thus should not exhibit laboratory-generated signals of homologous recombination. Our analysis shows that the IGSP data set contains only two phylogenetically-supported single recombinant sequences and no recombinant clades. In marked contrast, the non-IGSP data show a very large amount of potential recombination. We conclude that the presence of false positive signals in the non-IGSP data is more likely than false negatives in the IGSP data, and that given the evidence to date, homologous recombination seems to play little or no role in the evolution of influenza A viruses.},

	Abstract = {Summary
The 2013--2015 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic is caused by the Makona variant of Ebola virus (EBOV). Early in the epidemic, genome sequencing provided insights into virus evolution and transmission and offered important information for outbreak response. Here, we analyze sequences from 232 patients sampled over 7 months in Sierra Leone, along with 86 previously released genomes from earlier in the epidemic. We confirm sustained human-to-human transmission within Sierra Leone and find no evidence for import or export of EBOV across national borders after its initial introduction. Using high-depth replicate sequencing, we observe both host-to-host transmission and recurrent emergence of intrahost genetic variants. We trace the increasing impact of purifying selection in suppressing the accumulation of nonsynonymous mutations over time. Finally, we note changes in the mucin-like domain of EBOV glycoprotein that merit further investigation. These findings clarify the movement of EBOV within the region and describe viral evolution during prolonged human-to-human transmission.},

	Abstract = {West Africa is currently witnessing the most extensive Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak so far recorded. Until now, there have been 27,013 reported cases and 11,134 deaths. The origin of the virus is thought to have been a zoonotic transmission from a bat to a two-year-old boy in December 2013 (ref. 2). From this index case the virus was spread by human-to-human contact throughout Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. However, the origin of the particular virus in each country and time of transmission is not known and currently relies on epidemiological analysis, which may be unreliable owing to the difficulties of obtaining patient information. Here we trace the genetic evolution of EBOV in the current outbreak that has resulted in multiple lineages. Deep sequencing of 179 patient samples processed by the European Mobile Laboratory, the first diagnostics unit to be deployed to the epicentre of the outbreak in Guinea, reveals an epidemiological and evolutionary history of the epidemic from March 2014 to January 2015. Analysis of EBOV genome evolution has also benefited from a similar sequencing effort of patient samples from Sierra Leone. Our results confirm that the EBOV from Guinea moved into Sierra Leone, most likely in April or early May. The viruses of the Guinea/Sierra Leone lineage mixed around June/July 2014. Viral sequences covering August, September and October 2014 indicate that this lineage evolved independently within Guinea. These data can be used in conjunction with epidemiological information to test retrospectively the effectiveness of control measures, and provides an unprecedented window into the evolution of an ongoing viral haemorrhagic fever outbreak.},

	Abstract = {Summary
The 2013--present Western African Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak is the largest ever recorded with \&gt;28,000 reported cases. Ebola virus (EBOV) genome sequencing has played an important role throughout this outbreak; however, relatively few sequences have been determined from patients in Liberia, the second worst-affected country. Here, we report 140 EBOV genome sequences from the second wave of the Liberian outbreak and analyze them in combination with 782 previously published sequences from throughout the Western African outbreak. While multiple early introductions of EBOV to Liberia are evident, the majority of Liberian EVD cases are consistent with a single introduction, followed by spread and diversification within the country. Movement of the virus within Liberia was widespread, and reintroductions from Liberia served as an important source for the continuation of the already ongoing EVD outbreak in Guinea. Overall, little evidence was found for incremental adaptation of EBOV to the human host.},

	Abstract = {Genome segmentation facilitates reassortment and rapid evolution of influenza A virus. However, segmentation complicates particle assembly as virions must contain all eight vRNA species to be infectious. Specific packaging signals exist that extend into the coding regions of most if not all segments, but these RNA motifs are poorly defined. We measured codon variability in a large dataset of sequences to identify areas of low nucleotide sequence variation independent of amino acid conservation in each segment. Most clusters of codons showing very little synonymous variation were located at segment termini, consistent with previous experimental data mapping packaging signals. Certain internal regions of conservation, most notably in the PA gene, may however signify previously unidentified functions in the virus genome. To experimentally test the bioinformatics analysis, we introduced synonymous mutations into conserved codons within known packaging signals and measured incorporation of the mutant segment into virus particles. Surprisingly, in most cases, single nucleotide changes dramatically reduced segment packaging. Thus our analysis identifies cis-acting sequences in the influenza virus genome at the nucleotide level. Furthermore, we propose that strain-specific differences exist in certain packaging signals, most notably the haemagglutinin gene; this finding has major implications for the evolution of pandemic viruses.},

	Abstract = {Relaxed molecular clock models allow divergence time dating and "relaxed phylogenetic" inference, in which a time tree is estimated in the face of unequal rates across lineages. We present a new method for relaxing the assumption of a strict molecular clock using Markov chain Monte Carlo to implement Bayesian modeling averaging over random local molecular clocks. The new method approaches the problem of rate variation among lineages by proposing a series of local molecular clocks, each extending over a subregion of the full phylogeny. Each branch in a phylogeny (subtending a clade) is a possible location for a change of rate from one local clock to a new one. Thus, including both the global molecular clock and the unconstrained model results, there are a total of 22n-2 possible rate models available for averaging with 1, 2, ..., 2n - 2 different rate categories.},

	Abstract = {Variable rates of molecular evolution have been documented across the tree of life, but the cause of this observed variation within and among clades remains uncertain. In plants, it has been suggested that life history traits are correlated with the rate of molecular evolution, but previous studies have yielded conflicting results. Exceptionally large phylogenies of five major angiosperm clades demonstrate that rates of molecular evolution are consistently low in trees and shrubs, with relatively long generation times, as compared with related herbaceous plants, which generally have shorter generation times. Herbs show much higher rates of molecular change but also much higher variance in rates. Correlates of life history attributes have long been of interest to biologists, and our results demonstrate how changes in the rate of molecular evolution that are linked to life history traits can affect measurements of the tempo of evolution as well as our ability to identify and conserve biodiversity.},

	Abstract = {A novel Ebola virus (EBOV) first identified in March 2014 has infected more than 25,000 people in West Africa, resulting in more than 10,000 deaths. Preliminary analyses of genome sequences of 81 EBOV collected from March to June 2014 from Guinea and Sierra Leone suggest that the 2014 EBOV originated from an independent transmission event from its natural reservoir followed by sustained human-to-human infections. It has been reported that the EBOV genome variation might have an effect on the efficacy of sequence-based virus detection and candidate therapeutics. However, only limited viral information has been available since July 2014, when the outbreak entered a rapid growth phase. Here we describe 175 full-length EBOV genome sequences from five severely stricken districts in Sierra Leone from 28 September to 11 November 2014. We found that the 2014 EBOV has become more phylogenetically and genetically diverse from July to November 2014, characterized by the emergence of multiple novel lineages. The substitution rate for the 2014 EBOV was estimated to be 1.23 × 10−3 substitutions per site per year (95\% highest posterior density interval, 1.04 × 10−3 to 1.41 × 10−3 substitutions per site per year), approximating to that observed between previous EBOV outbreaks. The sharp increase in genetic diversity of the 2014 EBOV warrants extensive EBOV surveillance in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia to better understand the viral evolution and transmission dynamics of the ongoing outbreak. These data will facilitate the international efforts to develop vaccines and therapeutics.},

For pathogens with comparatively low per-site mutation rates, such as DNA viruses and bacteria, whole-genome sequencing can reveal the accumulation of novel genetic variation between population samples taken at different times. The concept of `measurably evolving populations' and related analytical approaches have provided powerful insights for fast-evolving RNA viruses, but their application to other pathogens is still in its infancy. We argue that previous distinctions between slow- and fast-evolving pathogens become blurred once evolution is assessed at a genome-wide scale, and we highlight important analytical challenges to be overcome to infer pathogen population dynamics from genomic data.},

The seroprevalence rate of Ebola antibody in wild-born chimpanzees was 12.9\%, indicating that (1) Ebola virus circulates in the forests of a large region of central Africa, including countries such as Cameroon, where no human cases of Ebola infections have been reported; (2) Ebola virus was present in the area before recent outbreaks in humans; (3) chimpanzees are continuously in contact with the virus; and (4) nonlethal Ebola infection can occur in chimpanzees. These results, together with the unexpected detection of Ebola-specific IgG in other species (5 drills, 1 baboon, 1 mandrill, and 1 Cercopithecus), may help to narrow the search for the reservoir of Ebola virus. They also suggest that future Ebola outbreaks may occur anywhere in the central African forest region.},

	Abstract = {A method for estimating the average level of gene flow among populations is introduced. The method provides an estimate of Nm, where N is the size of each local population in an island model and m is the migration rate. This method depends on knowing the phylogeny of the nonrecombining segments of DNA that are sampled. Given the phylogeny, the geographic location from which each sample is drawn is treated as multistate character with one state for each geographic location. A parsimony criterion applied to the evolution of this character on the phylogeny provides the minimum number of migration events consistent with the phylogeny. Extensive simulations show that the distribution of this minimum number is a simple function of Nm. Assuming the phylogeny is accurately estimated, this method provides an estimate of Nm that is as nearly as accurate as estimates obtained using FST and other statistics when Nm is moderate. Two examples of the use of this method with mitochondrial DNA data are presented.},

	Abstract = {Effective population size is fundamental in population genetics and characterizes genetic diversity. To infer past population dynamics from molecular sequence data, coalescent-based models have been developed for Bayesian nonparametric estimation of effective population size over time. Among the most successful is a Gaussian Markov random field ({GMRF}) model for a single gene locus. Here, we present a generalization of the {GMRF} model that allows for the analysis of multilocus sequence data. Using simulated data, we demonstrate the improved performance of our method to recover true population trajectories and the time to the most recent common ancestor ({TMRCA}). We analyze a multilocus alignment of {HIV}-1 {CRF}02\_AG gene sequences sampled from Cameroon. Our results are consistent with {HIV} prevalence data and uncover some aspects of the population history that go undetected in Bayesian parametric estimation. Finally, we recover an older and more reconcilable {TMRCA} for a classic ancient {DNA} data set.},

	Abstract = {Recombination contributes to the generation of genetic diversity in human immunodeficiency viruses ({HIV}) but can only occur between viruses replicating within the same cell. Since individuals have not been found to be simultaneously coinfected with multiple divergent strains of {HIV}-1 or {HIV}-2, recombination events have been thought to be restricted to the rather closely related members of the quasispecies that evolves during the course of {HIV} infection. Here we describe examples of both {HIV}-1 and {HIV}-2 genomes that appear to be hybrids of genetically quite divergent viruses. Phylogenetic analyses were used to examine the evolutionary relationships among multiple {HIV} strains. Evolutionary trees derived from different genomic regions were consistent with respect to most of the viruses investigated. However, some strains of {HIV}-1 and {HIV}-2 exhibited significantly discordant branching orders indicative of genetic exchanges during their evolutionary histories. The crossover points of these putative recombination events were mapped by examining the distribution of phylogenetically informative sites supporting alternative tree topologies. A similar example of a recombinant simian immunodeficiency virus identified in West African green monkeys has also been described recently. These results indicate that coinfection with highly divergent viral strains can occur in {HIV}-infected humans and {SIV}-infected primates and could lead to the generation of hybrid genomes with significantly altered biological properties. Thus, future characterization of primate lentiviruses should include careful phylogenetic investigation of possible genomic mosaicism.},

	Abstract = {The {SD}0 mutant of influenza virus A/{WSN}/33 ({WSN}), characterized by a 24-amino-acid deletion in the neuraminidase ({NA}) stalk, does not grow in embryonated chicken eggs because of defective {NA} function. Continuous passage of {SD}0 in eggs yielded 10 independent clones that replicated efficiently. Characterization of these egg-adapted viruses showed that five of the viruses contained insertions in the {NA} gene from the {PB}1, {PB}2, or {NP} gene, in the region linking the transmembrane and catalytic head domains, demonstrating that recombination of influenza viral {RNA} segments occurs relatively frequently. The other five viruses did not contain insertions in this region but displayed decreased binding affinity toward sialylglycoconjugates, compared with the binding properties of the parental virus. Sequence analysis of one of the latter viruses revealed mutations in the hemagglutinin ({HA}) gene, at sites in close proximity to the sialic acid receptor-binding pocket. These mutations appear to compensate for reduced {NA} function due to stalk deletions. Thus, balanced {HA}-{NA} functions are necessary for efficient influenza virus replication.},

	Abstract = {H9N2 influenza A viruses have become established worldwide in terrestrial poultry and wild birds, and are occasionally transmitted to mammals including humans and pigs. To comprehensively elucidate the genetic and evolutionary characteristics of H9N2 influenza viruses, we performed a large-scale sequence analysis of 571 viral genomes from the {NCBI} Influenza Virus Resource Database, representing the spectrum of H9N2 influenza viruses isolated from 1966 to 2009. Our study provides a panoramic framework for better understanding the genesis and evolution of H9N2 influenza viruses, and for describing the history of H9N2 viruses circulating in diverse hosts. Panorama phylogenetic analysis of the eight viral gene segments revealed the complexity and diversity of H9N2 influenza viruses. The 571 H9N2 viral genomes were classified into 74 separate lineages, which had marked host and geographical differences in phylogeny. Panorama genotypical analysis also revealed that H9N2 viruses include at least 98 genotypes, which were further divided according to their {HA} lineages into seven series (A--G). Phylogenetic analysis of the internal genes showed that H9N2 viruses are closely related to H3, H4, H5, H7, H10, and H14 subtype influenza viruses. Our results indicate that H9N2 viruses have undergone extensive reassortments to generate multiple reassortants and genotypes, suggesting that the continued circulation of multiple genotypical H9N2 viruses throughout the world in diverse hosts has the potential to cause future influenza outbreaks in poultry and epidemics in humans. We propose a nomenclature system for identifying and unifying all lineages and genotypes of H9N2 influenza viruses in order to facilitate international communication on the evolution, ecology and epidemiology of H9N2 influenza viruses.},

	Abstract = {A highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, H5N1, caused disease outbreaks in poultry in China and seven other east Asian countries between late 2003 and early 2004; the same virus was fatal to humans in Thailand and Vietnam. Here we demonstrate a series of genetic reassortment events traceable to the precursor of the H5N1 viruses that caused the initial human outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997 (refs 2--4) and subsequent avian outbreaks in 2001 and 2002 (refs 5, 6). These events gave rise to a dominant H5N1 genotype (Z) in chickens and ducks that was responsible for the regional outbreak in 2003--04. Our findings indicate that domestic ducks in southern China had a central role in the generation and maintenance of this virus, and that wild birds may have contributed to the increasingly wide spread of the virus in Asia. Our results suggest that H5N1 viruses with pandemic potential have become endemic in the region and are not easily eradicable. These developments pose a threat to public and veterinary health in the region and potentially the world, and suggest that long-term control measures are required.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of emergence and circulation of new human seasonal influenza virus variants is a key scientific and public health challenge. The global circulation patterns of influenza A/H3N2 viruses are well characterized, but the patterns of A/H1N1 and B viruses have remained largely unexplored. Here we show that the global circulation patterns of A/H1N1 (up to 2009), B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata viruses differ substantially from those of A/H3N2 viruses, on the basis of analyses of 9,604 haemagglutinin sequences of human seasonal influenza viruses from 2000 to 2012. Whereas genetic variants of A/H3N2 viruses did not persist locally between epidemics and were reseeded from East and Southeast Asia, genetic variants of A/H1N1 and B viruses persisted across several seasons and exhibited complex global dynamics with East and Southeast Asia playing a limited role in disseminating new variants. The less frequent global movement of influenza A/H1N1 and B viruses coincided with slower rates of antigenic evolution, lower ages of infection, and smaller, less frequent epidemics compared to A/H3N2 viruses. Detailed epidemic models support differences in age of infection, combined with the less frequent travel of children, as probable drivers of the differences in the patterns of global circulation, suggesting a complex interaction between virus evolution, epidemiology, and human behaviour.},

@article{ho_clock_2011,
	Abstract = {For over half a century, it has been known that the rate of morphological evolution appears to vary with the time frame of measurement. Rates of microevolutionary change, measured between successive generations, were found to be far higher than rates of macroevolutionary change inferred from the fossil record. More recently, it has been suggested that rates of molecular evolution are also time dependent, with the estimated rate depending on the timescale of measurement. This followed surprising observations that estimates of mutation rates, obtained in studies of pedigrees and laboratory mutation-accumulation lines, exceeded long-term substitution rates by an order of magnitude or more. Although a range of studies have provided evidence for such a pattern, the hypothesis remains relatively contentious. Furthermore, there is ongoing discussion about the factors that can cause molecular rate estimates to be dependent on time. Here we present an overview of our current understanding of time-dependent rates. We provide a summary of the evidence for time-dependent rates in animals, bacteria and viruses. We review the various biological and methodological factors that can cause rates to be time dependent, including the effects of natural selection, calibration errors, model misspecification and other artefacts. We also describe the challenges in calibrating estimates of molecular rates, particularly on the intermediate timescales that are critical for an accurate characterization of time-dependent rates. This has important consequences for the use of molecular-clock methods to estimate timescales of recent evolutionary events.},

@article{ho_2005,
	Abstract = {Studies of molecular evolutionary rates have yielded a wide range of rate estimates for various genes and taxa. Recent studies based on population-level and pedigree data have produced remarkably high estimates of mutation rate, which strongly contrast with substitution rates inferred in phylogenetic (species-level) studies. Using Bayesian analysis with a relaxed-clock model, we estimated rates for three groups of mitochondrial data: avian protein-coding genes, primate protein-coding genes, and primate d-loop sequences. In all three cases, we found a measurable transition between the high, short-term ({\textless}1--2 Myr) mutation rate and the low, long-term substitution rate. The relationship between the age of the calibration and the rate of change can be described by a vertically translated exponential decay curve, which may be used for correcting molecular date estimates. The phylogenetic substitution rates in mitochondria are approximately 0.5\% per million years for avian protein-coding sequences and 1.5\% per million years for primate protein-coding and d-loop sequences. Further analyses showed that purifying selection offers the most convincing explanation for the observed relationship between the estimated rate and the depth of the calibration. We rule out the possibility that it is a spurious result arising from sequence errors, and find it unlikely that the apparent decline in rates over time is caused by mutational saturation. Using a rate curve estimated from the d-loop data, several dates for last common ancestors were calculated: modern humans and Neandertals (354 ka; 222--705 ka), Neandertals (108 ka; 70--156 ka), and modern humans (76 ka; 47--110 ka). If the rate curve for a particular taxonomic group can be accurately estimated, it can be a useful tool for correcting divergence date estimates by taking the rate decay into account. Our results show that it is invalid to extrapolate molecular rates of change across different evolutionary timescales, which has important consequences for studies of populations, domestication, conservation genetics, and human evolution.},

	Abstract = {The rapid rates of viral evolution allow us to reconstruct the recent history of viruses in great detail. This feature, however, also results in rapid erosion of evolutionary signal within viral molecular data, impeding studies of their deep history. Thus, the further back in time, the less accurate the inference becomes. Furthermore, reconstructing complex histories of transmission can be challenging, especially where extinct viral lineages are concerned. This problem has been partially solved by the discovery of viruses embedded in host genomes, known as endogenous viral elements (EVEs). Some of these endogenous viruses are derived from ancient relatives of extant viruses, allowing us to better examine ancient viral host range, geographical distribution and transmission routes. Moreover, our knowledge of viral evolutionary timescales and rate dynamics has also been greatly improved by their discovery, thereby bridging the gap between recent and ancient viral evolution.},

@article{hayashida_1985,
	Abstract = {The nucleotide sequences of the eight different influenza A virus segments (genes) were compared among 14 different subtypes. These comparisons demonstrate the presence of molecular clocks in the viral genes; they accumulated both silent and amino acid-changing substitutions at approximately constant rates with respect to time during evolution. In addition, comparison of the rates of evolution among the eight viral genes, excluding the P2 gene, revealed a rapid and roughly equal rate of silent substitution for different genes. The P2 gene exception is explained as the result of recombination (reassortment) between distantly related strains. The rate of amino acid-changing substitution differs greatly from gene to gene. The rate of silent substitution was estimated to be 1.1 X 10(-2)/site/year on the average--that is, about 2 X 10(6) times higher than eukaryotic gene equivalents, which is remarkable. Strain A/USSR/90/77 was shown to evolve with a rate that is similar to those of other strains but to behave as if replication was frozen during a certain period (Nakajima et al. 1978). The frozen period was estimated to be 25 yr on the basis of the molecular clock. A similar analysis revealed another example of frozen replication--in this case, apparently for a period of about 9 yr--in a duck strain, A/duck/Ontario/77.},

@article{carroll_2013,
	Abstract = {Viruses in the Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus genera (family Filoviridae) have been associated with large outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever in human and nonhuman primates. The first documented cases occurred in primates over 45 years ago, but the amount of virus genetic diversity detected within bat populations, which have recently been identified as potential reservoir hosts, suggests that the filoviruses are much older. Here, detailed Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analyses are performed on 97 whole-genome sequences, 55 of which are newly reported, to comprehensively examine molecular evolutionary rates and estimate dates of common ancestry for viruses within the family Filoviridae. Molecular evolutionary rates for viruses belonging to different species range from 0.46 × 10−4 nucleotide substitutions/site/year for Sudan ebolavirus to 8.21 × 10−4 nucleotide substitutions/site/year for Reston ebolavirus. Most recent common ancestry can be traced back only within the last 50 years for Reston ebolavirus and Zaire ebolavirus species and suggests that viruses within these species may have undergone recent genetic bottlenecks. Viruses within Marburg marburgvirus and Sudan ebolavirus species can be traced back further and share most recent common ancestors approximately 700 and 850 years before the present, respectively. Examination of the whole family suggests that members of the Filoviridae, including the recently described Lloviu virus, shared a most recent common ancestor approximately 10,000 years ago. These data will be valuable for understanding the evolution of filoviruses in the context of natural history as new reservoir hosts are identified and, further, for determining mechanisms of emergence, pathogenicity, and the ongoing threat to public health.},

	Abstract = {The 2014 epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) has had a devastating impact in West Africa. Sequencing of ebolavirus (EBOV) from infected individuals has revealed extensive genetic variation, leading to speculation that the virus may be adapting to humans, accounting for the scale of the 2014 outbreak. We computationally analyze the variation associated with all EVD outbreaks, and find none of the amino acid replacements lead to identifiable functional changes. These changes have minimal effect on protein structure, being neither stabilizing nor destabilizing, are not found in regions of the proteins associated with known functions and tend to cluster in poorly constrained regions of proteins, specifically intrinsically disordered regions. We find no evidence that the difference between the current and previous outbreaks is due to evolutionary changes associated with transmission to humans. Instead, epidemiological factors are likely to be responsible for the unprecedented spread of EVD.},

	Abstract = {Estimation of demographic history from nucleotide sequences represents an important component of many studies in molecular ecology. For example, knowledge of a population's history can allow us to test hypotheses about the impact of climatic and anthropogenic factors. In the past, demographic analysis was typically limited to relatively simple population models, such as exponential or logistic growth. More flexible approaches are now available, including skyline-plot methods that are able to reconstruct changes in population sizes through time. This technical review focuses on these skyline-plot methods. We describe some general principles relating to sampling design and data collection. We then provide an outline of the methodological framework, which is based on coalescent theory, before tracing the development of the various skyline-plot methods and describing their key features. The performance and properties of the methods are illustrated using two simulated data sets.},

To develop new therapies against infections caused by a virus, it is important to understand the virus's history---where, when, and why it has caused disease and how it has changed over time. For example, new human strains of the influenza type A virus originate from strains that infect animals and rapidly can become common in human populations. In contrast, influenza type B virus strains almost exclusively infect humans and are continuously present in human populations. Both types have a detrimental impact on global health, but the type B viruses are less well understood, partly because outbreaks have not been as extensively documented.
Vijaykrishna et al. have now investigated the history of the two strains of the influenza type B virus---called Victoria and Yamagata---that currently circulate in humans. To do this, they inspected the genetic sequences of 908 viruses taken from samples of confirmed type B infections collected across Australia and New Zealand over 13 years.
Individual virus particles of the same strain have genetic sequences that are very similar, but not completely identical. Vijaykrishna et al. showed that the diversity of the genetic sequences from the Victoria strain fluctuated between seasons, and particular genetic variants of Victoria only persisted in the population for 1--3 years. This indicates that Victoria viruses are under a lot of pressure to evolve, which results in so-called `bottlenecks' whereby only the viruses carrying particular varieties of genetic sequence survive. This fluctuating pattern resembles that of the better-understood type A seasonal flu strain H3N2.
On the other hand, there was little change in the genetic diversity of the Yamagata strains sampled over the same 13-year period. The Yamagata viruses have diversified to a greater extent and several different `varieties' of the virus tend to circulate together for long periods of time. For example, the three varieties of Yamagata virus circulating in 2013 evolved from a common parent virus that was circulating around 10 years ago.
Vijaykrishna et al. found that between disease outbreaks, there was greater variation in the ability of Victoria viruses to be transmitted in humans, but that they were generally more easily transmitted than the Yamagata viruses. Victoria viruses tend to infect younger patients than Yamagata viruses, which is thought to be due to differences in the molecules that help the viruses enter the cells of the respiratory tract.
These findings suggests that it might be possible to eradicate the more slowly evolving influenza B Yamagata virus through mass vaccination programs using existing vaccines. This would then allow researchers to focus on developing effective vaccines to target the other strains of influenza virus.

	Abstract = {Author Summary
Infections by the influenza A virus show highly seasonal patterns in temperate regions. Winter is flu season. Over the course of the autumn and winter, a small number of initial infections grow to encompass a significant proportion of the population. At the end of the winter, infection disappears. It has been suggested that the strains founding each temperate flu season originate from China and Southeast Asia, where influenza A is less seasonal. We test this hypothesis through analysis of genetic sequences from viruses sampled throughout the world between 1998 and 2009. We find that although China and Southeast Asia play the largest role in the migration network, temperate regions, particularly the {USA}, also make important contributions. Not all temperate strains of influenza die out with the end of the winter season. Instead many strains emigrate to more favorable climes. Thus, we find patterns of influenza transmission to be highly dynamic. Because of emigration out of temperate regions, mutations harbored by temperate strains of influenza A can spread to the global virus population. This means that regional public health decisions regarding influenza may have global impacts.},

Seed strains generally first reached Oceania, North America, and Europe, and later South America. This evidence suggests that once A (H3N2) viruses leave E-{SE} Asia, they are unlikely to contribute to long-term viral evolution.

	Abstract = {Author Summary{\textless}p{\textgreater}The winter seasonality of influenza A virus in temperate climates is one of the most puzzling epidemiological patterns in infectious disease. To help resolve the issue of influenza seasonality, we studied, using viral genome sequence data, the patterns of global migration of influenza A virus, particularly between the northern and southern hemispheres. A phylogenetic analysis of approximately 900 complete genomes of the H3N2 subtype of human influenza A virus sampled from New Zealand and Australia (southern hemisphere), and New York state, United States (northern hemisphere), revealed that cross-hemisphere migration frequently occurs in both directions and involves multiple viral strains. Such global viral traffic therefore contributes significantly to the introduction of new influenza epidemics in both northern and southern hemispheres. These results also show that influenza A virus migrates afar during non-epidemic periods, rather than persisting locally at low levels during the influenza ``off-season''. However, although this represents the largest and first bihemisphere study of its kind to our knowledge, the results highlight the need for sampling from tropical regions and during non-epidemic periods in temperate areas. Studies of this kind are critical to fully understand the geographical dispersal of influenza A virus and the role of climate in triggering seasonal epidemics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/sec{\textgreater}},

	Abstract = {Reassortments in the influenza virus---a process where strains exchange genetic segments---have been implicated in two out of three pandemics of the 20th century as well as the 2009 H1N1 outbreak. While advances in sequencing have led to an explosion in the number of whole-genome sequences that are available, an understanding of the rate and distribution of reassortments and their role in viral evolution is still lacking. An important factor in this is the paucity of automated tools for confident identification of reassortments from sequence data due to the challenges of analyzing large, uncertain viral phylogenies. We describe here a novel computational method, called {GiRaF} (Graph-incompatibility-based Reassortment Finder), that robustly identifies reassortments in a fully automated fashion while accounting for uncertainties in the inferred phylogenies. The algorithms behind {GiRaF} search large collections of Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC})-sampled trees for groups of incompatible splits using a fast biclique enumeration algorithm coupled with several statistical tests to identify sets of taxa with differential phylogenetic placement. {GiRaF} correctly finds known reassortments in human, avian, and swine influenza populations, including the evolutionary events that led to the recent `swine flu' outbreak. {GiRaF} also identifies several previously unreported reassortments via whole-genome studies to catalog events in H5N1 and swine influenza isolates.},

If we assume that trait evolution can be described by a continuous-time Markov chain, then it suffices to study the process that counts labeled transitions of the chain. For a binary trait, we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain closed-form analytic solutions for the probability mass and probability generating functions of this evolutionary counting process. In the general, multi-state case we show how to compute moments of the counting process using an eigen decomposition of the infinitesimal generator, provided the latter is a diagonalizable matrix. We conclude with two examples that demonstrate the utility of our results.},

	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: There is an increasing need to develop bioinformatic tools to organise and analyse the rapidly growing amount of nucleotide and amino acid sequence data in organisms ranging from viruses to eukaryotes.
{FINDING}: A simple sequence editor ({SSE}) was developed to create an integrated environment where sequences can be aligned, annotated, classified and directly analysed by a number of built-in bioinformatic programs. {SSE} incorporates a sequence editor for the creation of sequence alignments, a process assisted by integrated {CLUSTAL}/{MUSCLE} alignment programs and automated removal of indels. Sequences can be fully annotated and classified into groups and annotated of sequences and sequence groups and access to analytical programs that analyse diversity, recombination and {RNA} secondary structure. Methods for analysing sequence diversity include measures of divergence and evolutionary distances, identity plots to detect regions of nucleotide or amino acid homology, reconstruction of sequence changes, mono-, di- and higher order nucleotide compositional biases and codon usage.Association Index calculations, {GroupScans}, Bootscanning and {TreeOrder} scans perform phylogenetic analyses that reconcile group membership with tree branching orders and provide powerful methods for examining segregation of alleles and detection of recombination events. Phylogeny changes across alignments and scoring of branching order differences between trees using the Robinson-Fould algorithm allow effective visualisation of the sites of recombination events.{RNA} secondary and tertiary structures play important roles in gene expression and {RNA} virus replication. For the latter, persistence of infection is additionally associated with pervasive {RNA} secondary structure throughout viral genomic {RNA} that modulates interactions with innate cell defences. {SSE} provides several programs to scan alignments for {RNA} secondary structure through folding energy thermodynamic calculations and phylogenetic methods (detection of co-variant changes, and structure conservation between divergent sequences). These analyses complement methods based on detection of sequence constraints, such as suppression of synonymous site variability.For each program, results can be plotted in real time during analysis through an integrated graphics package, providing publication quality graphs. Results can be also directed to tabulated datafiles for import into spreadsheet or database programs for further analysis.
{CONCLUSIONS}: {SSE} combines sequence editor functions with analytical tools in a comprehensive and user-friendly package that assists considerably in bioinformatic and evolution research.},

@article{hall_2013,
	Abstract = {Of the three foot-and-mouth-disease virus SAT serotypes mainly confined to sub-Saharan Africa, SAT 2 is the strain most often recorded in domestic animals and has caused outbreaks in North Africa and the Middle East six times in the last 25 years, with three apparently separate events occurring in 2012. This study updates the picture of SAT 2 phylogenetics by using all available sequences for the VP1 section of the genome available at the time of writing and uses phylogeographic methods to trace the origin of all outbreaks occurring north of the Sahara since 1990 and identify patterns of spread among countries of endemicity. Transitions between different host species are also enumerated. Outbreaks in North Africa appear to have origins in countries immediately south of the Sahara, whereas those in the Middle East are more often from East Africa. The results of the analysis of spread within sub-Saharan Africa are consistent with it being driven by relatively short-distance movements of animals across national borders, and the analysis of host species transitions supports the role of the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) as an important natural reservoir.
IMPORTANCE Foot-and-mouth disease virus is a livestock pathogen of major economic importance, with seven distinct serotypes occurring globally. The SAT 2 serotype, endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, has caused a number of outbreaks in North Africa and the Middle East during the last decades, including three separate incidents in 2012. A comprehensive analysis of all available RNA sequences for SAT 2 has not been published for some years. In this work, we performed this analysis using all previously published sequences and 49 newly determined examples. We also used phylogenetic methods to infer the source country for all outbreaks occurring outside sub-Saharan Africa since 1990 and to reconstruct the spread of viral lineages between countries where it is endemic and movements between different host species.},

We investigated the host switching of Staphylococcus aureus over a long evolutionary timeframe by developing Bayesian phylogenetic methods to account for uncertainty about past host associations and using estimates of evolutionary rates from serially sampled whole-genome data. Results suggest multiple jumps back and forth between human and bovids with the first switch from humans to bovids taking place around 5500 BP, coinciding with the expansion of cattle domestication throughout the Old World. The first switch to poultry is estimated at around 275 BP, long after domestication but still preceding large-scale commercial farming. These results are consistent with a central role for anthropogenic change in the emergence of new endemic diseases.},

	Abstract = {Author Summary
Spreading in time and space, rapidly evolving viruses can accumulate a considerable amount of genetic variation. As a consequence, viral genomes become valuable resources to reconstruct the spatial and temporal processes that are shaping epidemic or endemic dynamics. In molecular epidemiology, spatial inference is often limited to the interpretation of evolutionary histories with respect to the sampling locations of the pathogens. To test hypotheses about the spatial diffusion patterns of viruses, analytical techniques are required that enable us to reconstruct how viruses migrated in the past. Here, we develop a model to infer diffusion processes among discrete locations in timed evolutionary histories in a statistically efficient fashion. Applications to Avian Influenza A H5N1 and Rabies virus in Central and West African dogs demonstrate several advantages of simultaneously inferring spatial and temporal processes from gene sequences.},

@article{felsenstein_comparative_1985,
	Abstract = {Comparative studies of the relationship between two phenotypes, or between a phenotype and an environment, are frequently carried out by invalid statistical methods. Most regression, correlation, and contingency table methods, including nonparametric methods, assume that the points are drawn independently from a common distribution. When species are taken from a branching phylogeny, they are manifestly nonindependent. Use of a statistical method that assumes independence will cause overstatement of the significance in hypothesis tests. Some illustrative examples of these phenomena have been given, and limitations of previous proposals of ways to correct for the nonindependence have been discussed. A method of correcting for the phylogeny has been proposed. It requires that we know both the tree topology and the branch lengths, and that we be willing to allow the characters to be modeled by Brownian motion on a linear scale. Given these conditions, the phylogeny specifies a set of contrasts among species, contrasts that are statistically independent and can be used in regression or correlation studies. The considerable barriers to making practical use of this technique have been discussed.},

@article{muller_2015,
	Abstract = {SummaryBackground
Scientific evidence suggests that dromedary camels are the intermediary host for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). However, the actual number of infections in people who have had contact with camels is unknown and most index patients cannot recall any such contact. We aimed to do a nationwide serosurvey in Saudi Arabia to establish the prevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies, both in the general population and in populations of individuals who have maximum exposure to camels.
Methods
In the cross-sectional serosurvey, we tested human serum samples obtained from healthy individuals older than 15 years who attended primary health-care centres or participated in a national burden-of-disease study in all 13 provinces of Saudi Arabia. Additionally, we tested serum samples from shepherds and abattoir workers with occupational exposure to camels. Samples were screened by recombinant ELISA and MERS-CoV seropositivity was confirmed by recombinant immunofluorescence and plaque reduction neutralisation tests. We used two-tailed Mann Whitney U exact tests, χ2, and Fisher's exact tests to analyse the data.
Findings
Between Dec 1, 2012, and Dec 1, 2013, we obtained individual serum samples from 10 009 individuals. Anti-MERS-CoV antibodies were confirmed in 15 (0·15\%; 95\% CI 0·09--0·24) of 10 009 people in six of the 13 provinces. The mean age of seropositive individuals was significantly younger than that of patients with reported, laboratory-confirmed, primary Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (43·5 years [SD 17·3] vs 53·8 years [17·5]; p=0·008). Men had a higher antibody prevalence than did women (11 [0·25\%] of 4341 vs two [0·05\%] of 4378; p=0·028) and antibody prevalence was significantly higher in central versus coastal provinces (14 [0·26\%] of 5479 vs one [0·02\%] of 4529; p=0·003). Compared with the general population, seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies was significantly increased by 15 times in shepherds (two [2·3\%] of 87, p=0·0004) and by 23 times in slaughterhouse workers (five [3·6\%] of 140; p\&lt;0·0001).
Interpretation
Seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies was significantly higher in camel-exposed individuals than in the general population. By simple multiplication, a projected 44 951 (95\% CI 26 971--71 922) individuals older than 15 years might be seropositive for MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia. These individuals might be the source of infection for patients with confirmed MERS who had no previous exposure to camels.

We describe a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling procedure that efficiently samples a variant of the generalized skyline plot, given sequence data, and combines these plots to generate a posterior distribution of effective population size through time. We apply the Bayesian skyline plot to simulated data sets and show that it correctly reconstructs demographic history under canonical scenarios. Finally, we compare the Bayesian skyline plot model to previous coalescent approaches by analyzing two real data sets (hepatitis C virus in Egypt and mitochondrial DNA of Beringian bison) that have been previously investigated using alternative coalescent methods. In the bison analysis, we detect a severe but previously unrecognized bottleneck, estimated to have occurred 10,000 radiocarbon years ago, which coincides with both the earliest undisputed record of large numbers of humans in Alaska and the megafaunal extinctions in North America at the beginning of the Holocene.},

The simulations reveal that (i) the performance of exponential growth model estimates is determined by a simple function of the true parameter values and (ii) under some conditions, estimates from reconstructed trees perform as well as estimates from perfect trees.

@article{yoder_2000,
	Abstract = {Protein-coding genes of the mitochondrial genomes from 31 mammalian species were analyzed to estimate the speciation dates within primates and also between rats and mice. Three calibration points were used based on paleontological data: one at 20--25 MYA for the hominoid/cercopithecoid divergence, one at 53--57 MYA for the cetacean/artiodactyl divergence, and the third at 110--130 MYA for the metatherian/eutherian divergence. Both the nucleotide and the amino acid sequences were analyzed, producing conflicting results. The global molecular clock was clearly violated for both the nucleotide and the amino acid data. Models of local clocks were implemented using maximum likelihood, allowing different evolutionary rates for some lineages while assuming rate constancy in others. Surprisingly, the highly divergent third codon positions appeared to contain phylogenetic information and produced more sensible estimates of primate divergence dates than did the amino acid sequences. Estimated dates varied considerably depending on the data type, the calibration point, and the substitution model but differed little among the four tree topologies used. We conclude that the calibration derived from the primate fossil record is too recent to be reliable; we also point out a number of problems in date estimation when the molecular clock does not hold. Despite these obstacles, we derived estimates of primate divergence dates that were well supported by the data and were generally consistent with the paleontological record. Estimation of the mouse-rat divergence date, however, was problematic.},

This requires more favorable amino acid replacements fixed in antigenic sites among the surviving lineages than among the extinct lineages. We now show that viral hemagglutinins fix proportionately more amino acid replacements in antigenic sites in the trunk of the evolutionary tree (survivors) than in the branches (nonsurvivors), demonstrating that type A human influenza virus is undergoing positive Darwinian evolution. The hemagglutinin gene is evolving 3 times faster than the nonstructural gene and the average age of the sampled nonsurvivors is only 1.6 years, so that extinction is not only common but rapid.},

@article{felsenstein_bootstrap_1985,
	Abstract = {The recently-developed statistical method known as the "bootstrap" can be used to place confidence intervals on phylogenies. It involves resampling points from one's own data, with replacement, to create a series of bootstrap samples of the same size as the original data. Each of these is analyzed, and the variation among the resulting estimates taken to indicate the size of the error involved in making estimates from the original data. In the case of phylogenies, it is argued that the proper method of resampling is to keep all of the original species while sampling characters with replacement, under the assumption that the characters have been independently drawn by the systematist and have evolved independently. Majority-rule consensus trees can be used to construct a phylogeny showing all of the inferred monophyletic groups that occurred in a majority of the bootstrap samples. If a group shows up 95\% of the time or more, the evidence for it is taken to be statistically significant. Existing computer programs can be used to analyze different bootstrap samples by using weights on the characters, the weight of a character being how many times it was drawn in bootstrap sampling. When all characters are perfectly compatible, as envisioned by Hennig, bootstrap sampling becomes unnecessary; the bootstrap method would show significant evidence for a group if it is defined by three or more characters.},

@article{felsenstein_1973,
	Abstract = {The general maximum likelihood approach to the statistical estimation of phylogenies is outlined, for data in which there are a number of discrete states for each character. The details of the maximum likelihood method will depend on the details of the probabilistic model of evolution assumed. There are a very large number of possible models of evolution. For a few of the simpler models, the calculation of the likelihood of an evolutionary tree is outlined. For these models, the maximum likelihood tree will be the same as the ``most parsimonious'' (or minimum-steps) tree if the probability of change during the evolution of the group is assumed a priori to be very small. However, most sets of data require too many assumed state changes per character to be compatible with this assumption. Farris (1973) has argued that maximum likelihood and parsimony methods are identical under a much less restrictive set of assumptions. It is argued that the present methods are preferable to his, and a counterexample to his argument is presented. An algorithm which enables rapid calculation of the likelihood of a phylogeny is described.},

@article{rannala_1996,
	Abstract = {A new method is presented for inferring evolutionary trees using nucleotide sequence data. The birth-death process is used as a model of speciation and extinction to specify the prior distribution of phylogenies and branching times. Nucleotide substitution is modeled by a continuous-time Markov process. Parameters of the branching model and the substitution model are estimated by maximum likelihood. The posterior probabilities of different phylogenies are calculated and the phylogeny with the highest posterior probability is chosen as the best estimate of the evolutionary relationship among species. We refer to this as the maximum posterior probability (MAP) tree. The posterior probability provides a natural measure of the reliability of the estimated phylogeny. Two example data sets are analyzed to infer the phylogenetic relationship of human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan. The best trees estimated by the new method are the same as those from the maximum likelihood analysis of separate topologies, but the posterior probabilities are quite different from the bootstrap proportions. The results of the method are found to be insensitive to changes in the rate parameter of the branching process.},

First, there is a section of three chapters dealing with changes in protein metabolism during evolution and during growth and development. At its most fundamental level, this part deals in reality with an aspect of regulation of protein metabolism, since differences in metabolism between species and changes occurring during growth are both outward expressions of genetic control mechanisms that determine the form and characteristics of an animal. The other section in this volume is a survey of methods appropriate to the study of protein metabolism in mammals.

	Abstract = {We investigate the shape of a phylogenetic tree reconstructed from sequences evolving under the coalescent with recombination. The motivation is that evolutionary inferences are often made from phylogenetic trees reconstructed from population data even though recombination may well occur (mtDNA or viral sequences) or does occur (nuclear sequences). We investigate the size and direction of biases when a single tree is reconstructed ignoring recombination. Standard software (PHYLIP) was used to construct the best phylogenetic tree from sequences simulated under the coalescent with recombination. With recombination present, the length of terminal branches and the total branch length are larger, and the time to the most recent common ancestor smaller, than for a tree reconstructed from sequences evolving with no recombination. The effects are pronounced even for small levels of recombination that may not be immediately detectable in a data set. The phylogenies when recombination is present superficially resemble phylogenies for sequences from an exponentially growing population. However, exponential growth has a different effect on statistics such as Tajima's D. Furthermore, ignoring recombination leads to a large overestimation of the substitution rate heterogeneity and the loss of the molecular clock. These results are discussed in relation to viral and mtDNA data sets.},

@article{anisimova_2003,
	Abstract = {Maximum-likelihood methods based on models of codon substitution accounting for heterogeneous selective pressures across sites have proved to be powerful in detecting positive selection in protein-coding DNA sequences. Those methods are phylogeny based and do not account for the effects of recombination. When recombination occurs, such as in population data, no unique tree topology can describe the evolutionary history of the whole sequence. This violation of assumptions raises serious concerns about the likelihood method for detecting positive selection. Here we use computer simulation to evaluate the reliability of the likelihood-ratio test (LRT) for positive selection in the presence of recombination. We examine three tests based on different models of variable selective pressures among sites. Sequences are simulated using a coalescent model with recombination and analyzed using codon-based likelihood models ignoring recombination. We find that the LRT is robust to low levels of recombination (with fewer than three recombination events in the history of a sample of 10 sequences). However, at higher levels of recombination, the type I error rate can be as high as 90\%, especially when the null model in the LRT is unrealistic, and the test often mistakes recombination as evidence for positive selection. The test that compares the more realistic models M7 (β) against M8 (β and ω) is more robust to recombination, where the null model M7 allows the positive selection pressure to vary between 0 and 1 (and so does not account for positive selection), and the alternative model M8 allows an additional discrete class with ω= dN/dS that could be estimated to be {\textgreater}1 (and thus accounts for positive selection). Identification of sites under positive selection by the empirical Bayes method appears to be less affected than the LRT by recombination.},

	Abstract = {Phylogenetic studies based on DNA sequences typically ignore the potential occurrence of recombination, which may produce different alignment regions with different evolutionary histories. Traditional phylogenetic methods assume that a single history underlies the data. If recombination is present, can we expect the inferred phylogeny to represent any of the underlying evolutionary histories? We examined this question by applying traditional phylogenetic reconstruction methods to simulated recombinant sequence alignments. The effect of recombination on phylogeny estimation depended on the relatedness of the sequences involved in the recombinational event and on the extent of the different regions with different phylogenetic histories. Given the topologies examined here, when the recombinational event was ancient, or when recombination occurred between closely related taxa, one of the two phylogenies underlying the data was generally inferred. In this scenario, the evolutionary history corresponding to the majority of the positions in the alignment was generally recovered. Very different results were obtained when recombination occurred recently among divergent taxa. In this case, when the recombinational breakpoint divided the alignment in two regions of similar length, a phylogeny that was different from any of the true phylogenies underlying the data was inferred.},

	Abstract = {SummaryBackground
An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been reported in Hong Kong. We investigated the viral cause and clinical presentation among 50 patients.
Methods
We analysed case notes and microbiological findings for 50 patients with SARS, representing more than five separate epidemiologically linked transmission clusters. We defined the clinical presentation and risk factors associated with severe disease and investigated the causal agents by chest radiography and laboratory testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates and sera samples. We compared the laboratory findings with those submitted for microbiological investigation of other diseases from patients whose identity was masked.
Findings
Patients' age ranged from 23 to 74 years. Fever, chills, myalgia, and cough were the most frequent complaints. When compared with chest radiographic changes, respiratory symptoms and auscultatory findings were disproportionally mild. Patients who were household contacts of other infected people and had older age, lymphopenia, and liver dysfunction were associated with severe disease. A virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae was isolated from two patients. By use of serological and reverse-transcriptase PCR specific for this virus, 45 of 50 patients with SARS, but no controls, had evidence of infection with this virus.
Interpretation
A coronavirus was isolated from patients with SARS that might be the primary agent associated with this disease. Serological and molecular tests specific for the virus permitted a definitive laboratory diagnosis to be made and allowed further investigation to define whether other cofactors play a part in disease progression.},

@article{gorbalenya_2006,
	Abstract = {This review focuses on the monophyletic group of animal RNA viruses united in the order Nidovirales. The order includes the distantly related coronaviruses, toroviruses, and roniviruses, which possess the largest known RNA genomes (from 26 to 32 kb) and will therefore be called `large' nidoviruses in this review. They are compared with their arterivirus cousins, which also belong to the Nidovirales despite having a much smaller genome (13--16 kb). Common and unique features that have been identified for either large or all nidoviruses are outlined. These include the nidovirus genetic plan and genome diversity, the composition of the replicase machinery and virus particles, virus-specific accessory genes, the mechanisms of RNA and protein synthesis, and the origin and evolution of nidoviruses with small and large genomes. Nidoviruses employ single-stranded, polycistronic RNA genomes of positive polarity that direct the synthesis of the subunits of the replicative complex, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and helicase. Replicase gene expression is under the principal control of a ribosomal frameshifting signal and a chymotrypsin-like protease, which is assisted by one or more papain-like proteases. A nested set of subgenomic RNAs is synthesized to express the 3′-proximal ORFs that encode most conserved structural proteins and, in some large nidoviruses, also diverse accessory proteins that may promote virus adaptation to specific hosts. The replicase machinery includes a set of RNA-processing enzymes some of which are unique for either all or large nidoviruses. The acquisition of these enzymes may have improved the low fidelity of RNA replication to allow genome expansion and give rise to the ancestors of small and, subsequently, large nidoviruses.},

	Abstract = {The practical need to partition the world of viruses into distinguishable, universally agreed upon entities is the ultimate justification for developing a virus classification system. Since 1971, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) operating on behalf of the world community of virologists has taken on the task of developing a single, universal taxonomic scheme for all viruses infecting animals (vertebrate, invertebrates, and protozoa), plants (higher plants and algae), fungi, bacteria, and archaea. The current report builds on the accumulated taxonomic construction of the eight previous reports dating back to 1971 and records the proceedings of the Committee since publication of the last report in 2005. Representing the work of more than 500 virologists worldwide, this report is the authoritative reference for virus organization, distinction, and structure.},

	Abstract = {Backround. The pandemic potential of avian influenza viruses A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) remains an unresolved but critically important question.
Methods. We compared the characteristics of sporadic and clustered cases of human H5N1 and H7N9 infection, estimated the relative risk of infection in blood-related contacts, and the reproduction number (R).
Results. We assembled and analyzed data on 720 H5N1 cases and 460 H7N9 cases up to November 02 2014. The severity and average age of sporadic/index cases of H7N9 was greater than secondary cases (71\% requiring ICU admission versus 33\%, p=0·007; median age 59 years versus 31, p{\textless}0·001). We observed no significant differences in the age and severity between sporadic/index and secondary H5N1 cases. The upper limit of the 95\% CI for reproduction number (R) was 0·12 for H5N1 and 0·27 for H7N9. A higher proportion of H5N1 infections occurred in clusters (20\%) compared to H7N9 (8\%). The relative risk of infection in blood-related contacts of cases compared to unrelated contacts was 8.96 for H5N1 (95\% CI 1.30, 61.86) and 0.80 for H7N9 (95\% CI 0.32, 1.97).
Conclusions. The results are consistent with an ascertainment bias towards severe and older cases for sporadic H7N9 but not for H5N1. The lack of evidence for ascertainment bias in sporadic H5N1 cases, the more pronounced clustering of cases, and the higher risk of infection in blood-related contacts, support the hypothesis that susceptibility to H5N1 may be limited and familial. This analysis suggests the potential pandemic risk may be greater for H7N9 than H5N1.},

	Abstract = {The RNA of the human influenza virus Singapore (H2N2) strain has been labeled in vivo by phosphorus-32 and separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis into eight segments, which were correlated to the corresponding gene functions and/or proteins. The base sequence homology between the individual genes (segments) of the H2N2 virus and those of different influenza A strains has been determined by molecular hybridization. Segments 1, 5, 7, and 8 of the Singapore strain exhibit a base sequence homology of almost 100\% as compared to the FM1 strain (HlNl), while the homology between the other segments is significantly lower (24--76\%). For the Singapore and Hong Kong (H3N2) strains all segments except that coding for the hemagglutinin (HA, 24\%) exhibit a homology close to 100\%. The 32P-labeled segment 4 (HA-gene) of the avian influenza A strain duck Ukraine (Hav7Neg2) shows a homology of 92\% to Hong Kong, while the homology of at least two other segments is significantly lower. These results are taken as an indication that the H2N2 subtype is derived from the HlN1 subtype by a recombination event retaining four H1N1 segments, while the other four segments are gained from another yet unknown strain. The H3N2 subtype is presumably derived from a H2N2 subtype, retaining seven segments of the H2N2 subtype, while the gene coding for the HA is obtained from the duck Ukraine or another highly related strain.},

@article{parrish_2008,
	Abstract = {Summary: Host range is a viral property reflecting natural hosts that are infected either as part of a principal transmission cycle or, less commonly, as ``spillover'' infections into alternative hosts. Rarely, viruses gain the ability to spread efficiently within a new host that was not previously exposed or susceptible. These transfers involve either increased exposure or the acquisition of variations that allow them to overcome barriers to infection of the new hosts. In these cases, devastating outbreaks can result. Steps involved in transfers of viruses to new hosts include contact between the virus and the host, infection of an initial individual leading to amplification and an outbreak, and the generation within the original or new host of viral variants that have the ability to spread efficiently between individuals in populations of the new host. Here we review what is known about host switching leading to viral emergence from known examples, considering the evolutionary mechanisms, virus-host interactions, host range barriers to infection, and processes that allow efficient host-to-host transmission in the new host population.},

	Abstract = {The RNAs of several avian tumor virus recombinants that had inherited their focus-forming ability from a sarcoma virus and their host range marker from a leukosis virus were investigated. Electrophoretic analyses showed that the cloned sarcoma virus recombinants contained only size class a RNA, although they had acquired a marker that resided on class b RNA in the leukosis virus parent. Class a RNA of different recombinant clones, derived from the same pair of parental viruses and selected for the same biological markers, differed slightly in electrophoretic mobility from each other and from the parental sarcoma virus. They were also found to have different fingerprints of RNase T1-resistant oligonucleotides., The average complexity of the 60-70S RNA prepared from Prague Rous sarcoma virus of subgroup B was estimated to be 3.5 × 106 daltons from the size of 20 RNase T1-resistant oligonucleotides, which represented 3.9\% of the RNA and that of a recombinant to be 3.3 × 106 daltons from 23 oligonucleotides, which represented 4.7\% of the RNA. This result suggests that the genome of wild-type and of recombinant RNA tumor viruses is polyploid., The sum of these observations led us to propose that recombination among avian tumor viruses occurred by crossing-over between homologous pieces of nucleic acid.},

@article{jetzt_2000,
	Abstract = {The diploid nature of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) indicates that recombination serves a central function in virus replication and evolution. Previously, while examining the nature of obligatory primer strand transfers during reverse transcription, a high rate of recombination was observed at the ends of the viral genome within the viral long terminal repeats, prompting the following question: does recombination occur at a high rate throughout the genome? To address this question, two vectors based upon different strains of HIV-1 were utilized. The vectors were comprised predominantly of autologous HIV-1 sequence and were approximately the same size as the parental genome. The proviral progeny of heterodimeric virions were analyzed after a single cycle of replication, and the sequence heterogeneity between the two strains allowed direct examination of recombination crossovers. The results obtained indicate that HIV-1 undergoes approximately two to three recombination events per genome per replication cycle. These results imply that both HIV-1 RNAs are typically utilized during reverse transcription and that recombination is an important aspect of HIV-1 replication.},

	Abstract = {RNA viruses are often thought of as possessing almost limitless adaptability as a result of their extreme mutation rates. However, high mutation rates also put a cap on the size of the viral genome by establishing an error threshold, beyond which lethal numbers of deleterious mutations accumulate. Herein, I argue that a lack of genomic space means that RNA viruses will be subject to important evolutionary constraints because specific sequences are required to encode multiple and often conflicting functions. Empirical evidence for these constraints, and how they limit viral adaptability, is now beginning to accumulate. Documenting the constraints to RNA virus evolution has important implications for predicting the emergence of new viruses and for improving therapeutic procedures.},

We sought evidence for RNA 3′ → 5′ exonuclease proofreading mechanisms by varying the concentrations of the next nucleoside triphosphate, by incorporation ofnucleoside [1-thio]triphosphate analogues of the four natural RNA nucleosides, and by varying the concentrations of pyrophosphate in the in vitro polymerase reaction. None of these perturbations greatly affected viral RNA polymerase fidelity at the site studied. These results fail to show evidence for proofreading exonuclease activity associated with the virion replicase of an RNA virus.

@article{ito_2001,
	Abstract = {Using the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotype system, we studied the functional properties of the Ebola virus glycoprotein (GP). Amino acid substitutions at the GP cleavage site, which reduce glycoprotein cleavability and viral infectivity in some viruses, did not appreciably change the infectivity of VSV pseudotyped with GP. Likewise, removal of two acylated cysteine residues in the transmembrane region of GP showed no discernible effects on infectivity. Although most filoviruses are believed to target endothelial cells and hepatocytes preferentially, the GP-carrying VSV showed greater affinity for epithelial cells than for either of these cell types, indicating that Ebola virus GP does not necessarily have strong tropism toward endothelial cells and hepatocytes. Finally, when it was used to screen for neutralizing antibodies against Ebola virus GP, the VSV pseudotype system allowed us to detect strain-specific neutralizing activity that was inhibited by secretory GP (SGP). This finding provides evidence of shared neutralizing epitopes on GP and SGP molecules and indicates the potential of SGP to serve as a decoy for neutralizing antibodies.},

@article{sanchez_1996,
	Abstract = {In late 1994 and early 1995, Ebola (EBO) virus dramatically reemerged in Africa, causing human disease in the Ivory Coast and Zaire. Analysis of the entire glycoprotein genes of these viruses and those of other EBO virus subtypes has shown that the virion glycoprotein (130 kDa) is encoded in two reading frames, which are linked by transcriptional editing. This editing results in the addition of an extra nontemplated adenosine within a run of seven adenosines near the middle of the coding region. The primary gene product is a smaller (50-70 kDa), nonstructural, secreted glycoprotein, which is produced in large amounts and has an unknown function. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that EBO virus subtypes are genetically diverse and that the recent Ivory Coast isolate represents a new (fourth) subtype of EBO virus. In contrast, the EBO virus isolate from the 1995 outbreak in Kikwit, Zaire, is virtually identical to the virus that caused a similar epidemic in Yambuku, Zaire, almost 20 years earlier. This genetic stability may indicate that EBO viruses have coevolved with their natural reservoirs and do not change appreciably in the wild.},

	Abstract = {The glycoprotein gene of Ebola virus contains a translational stop codon in the middle, thus preventing synthesis of full-length glycoprotein. Twenty percent of the mRNA isolated from Ebola virus-infected cells was shown to be edited, containing one additional nontemplate A in a stretch of seven consecutive A residues. Only the edited mRNA species encoded full-length glycoprotein, whereas the exact copies of the viral template coded for a smaller secreted glycoprotein. Expression of the glycoprotein by anin vitrotranscription/translation system, by the vaccinia virus/T7 polymerase system, and by recombinant vaccinia virus revealed that full-length glycoprotein was synthesized not only when the edited glycoprotein gene (8A's) was used as a template for T7 and vaccinia virus polymerases, but also when the nonedited (genomic) glycoprotein gene was used. Analysis of mRNA produced by T7 and vaccinia virus polymerase from the 7A's construct revealed that 1--5\% contained alterations at the same site that was also edited by the Ebola virus polymerase. Our data indicate that the editing site in the Ebola virus glycoprotein gene is recognized not only by Ebola virus polymerase but also by DNA-dependent RNA polymerases of different origin.},

Many illnesses, including influenza, hemorrhagic fever, and rabies, are caused by a group of viruses called negative-sense RNA viruses. The genetic information---or genome---of these viruses is encoded in strands of RNA that must be copied before they can be translated into the proteins needed to build new viruses. It is currently known that there are at least eight different families of these viruses, which have a wide range of shapes and sizes and arrange their RNA in different ways.
Insects, spiders, and other arthropods carry many different RNA viruses. Many of these viruses have not previously been studied, and those that have been studied so far are mainly those that cause diseases in humans and other vertebrates. Researchers therefore only know a limited amount about the diversity of the negative-sense RNA viruses that arthropods harbor and how these viruses evolved. Studying how viruses evolve helps scientists to understand what makes some viruses deadly and others harmless and can also help develop treatments or vaccines for the diseases caused by the viruses.
Li, Shi, Tian, Lin, Kang et al. collected 70 species of insects, spiders, centipedes, and other arthropods in China and sequenced all the negative-sense RNA viruses in the creatures. This revealed an enormous number of negative-sense RNA viruses, including 112 new viruses. Many of the newly discovered arthropod viruses appear to be the ancestors of disease-causing viruses, including influenza viruses and the filoviruses---the group that includes the Ebola virus. Indeed, it appears that arthropods host many---if not all---of the negative-sense RNA viruses that cause disease in vertebrates and plants.
While documenting the new RNA viruses and how they are related to each other, Li et al. found many different genome structures. Some genomes were segmented, which may play an important role in evolution as segments can be easily swapped to create new genetic combinations. Non-segmented and circular genomes were also found. This genetic diversity suggests that arthropods are likely to have played a key role in the evolution of new viruses by acting as a site where many different viruses can interact and exchange genetic information.

	Abstract = {An assay has been developed that allows the identification of molecules that function as type I IFN antagonists. Using this assay, we have identified an Ebola virus-encoded inhibitor of the type I IFN response, the Ebola virus VP35 protein. The assay relies on the properties of an influenza virus mutant, influenza delNS1 virus, which lacks the NS1 ORF and, therefore, does not produce the NS1 protein. When cells are infected with influenza delNS1 virus, large amounts of type I IFN are produced. As a consequence, influenza delNS1 virus replicates poorly. However, high-efficiency transient transfection of a plasmid encoding a protein that interferes with type I IFN-induced antiviral functions, such as the influenza A virus NS1 protein or the herpes simplex virus protein ICP34.5, rescues growth of influenza delNS1 virus. When plasmids expressing individual Ebola virus proteins were transfected into Madin Darby canine kidney cells, the Ebola virus VP35 protein enhanced influenza delNS1 virus growth more than 100-fold. VP35 subsequently was shown to block double-stranded RNA- and virus-mediated induction of an IFN-stimulated response element reporter gene and to block double-stranded RNA- and virus-mediated induction of the IFN-β promoter. The Ebola virus VP35 therefore is likely to inhibit induction of type I IFN in Ebola virus-infected cells and may be an important determinant of Ebola virus virulence in vivo.},

Here we refer to these situations as `relaxed selection,' and review recent studies that explore the effects of such changes on traits in their ecological contexts. In a few systems, such as the loss of armor in stickleback, the genetic, developmental and ecological bases of trait evolution are being discovered. These results yield insights into whether and how fast a trait is reduced or lost under relaxed selection. We provide a prospectus and a framework for understanding relaxed selection and trait loss in natural populations. We also examine its implications for applied issues, such as antibiotic resistance and the success of invasive species.},

	Abstract = {Populations of RNA viruses are often characterized by abundant genetic variation. However, the relative fitness of these mutations is largely unknown, although this information is central to our understanding of viral emergence, immune evasion, and drug resistance. Here we develop a phylogenetic method, based on the distribution of nonsynonymous and synonymous changes, to assess the relative fitness of polymorphisms in the structural genes of 143 RNA viruses. This reveals that a substantial proportion of the amino acid variation observed in natural populations of RNA viruses comprises transient deleterious mutations that are later purged by purifying selection, potentially limiting virus adaptability. We also demonstrate, for the first time, the existence of a relationship between amino acid variability and the phylogenetic distribution of polymorphisms. From this relationship, we propose an empirical threshold for the maximum viable deleterious mutation load in RNA viruses.},

	Abstract = {In the absence of direct epidemiological evidence, molecular evolutionary studies of primate lentiviruses provide the most definitive information about the origins of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and HIV-2. Related lentiviruses have been found infecting numerous species of primates in sub-Saharan Africa. The only species naturally infected with viruses closely related to HIV-2 is the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys) from western Africa, the region where HIV-2 is known to be endemic. Similarly, the only viruses very closely related to HIV-1 have been isolated from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), and in particular those from western equatorial Africa, again coinciding with the region that appears to be the hearth of the HIV-1 pandemic. HIV-1 and HIV-2 have each arisen several times: in the case of HIV-1, the three groups (M, N and O) are the result of independent cross-species transmission events. Consistent with the phylogenetic position of a 'fossil' virus from 1959, molecular clock analyses using realistic models of HIV-1 sequence evolution place the last common ancestor of the M group prior to 1940, and several lines of evidence indicate that the jump from chimpanzees to humans occurred before then. Both the inferred geographical origin of HIV-1 and the timing of the cross-species transmission are inconsistent with the suggestion that oral polio vaccines, putatively contaminated with viruses from chimpanzees in eastern equatorial Africa in the late 1950s, could be responsible for the origin of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: Statistical methods for comparing relative rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions maintain a central role in detecting positive selection. To identify selection, researchers often estimate the ratio of these relative rates () at individual alignment sites. Fitting a codon substitution model that captures heterogeneity in across sites provides a reliable way to perform such estimation, but it remains computationally prohibitive for massive datasets. By using crude estimates of the numbers of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions at each site, counting approaches scale well to large datasets, but they fail to account for ancestral state reconstruction uncertainty and to provide site-specific estimates.
Results: We propose a hybrid solution that borrows the computational strength of counting methods, but augments these methods with empirical Bayes modeling to produce a relatively fast and reliable method capable of estimating site-specific values in large datasets. Importantly, our hybrid approach, set in a Bayesian framework, integrates over the posterior distribution of phylogenies and ancestral reconstructions to quantify uncertainty about site-specific estimates. Simulations demonstrate that this method competes well with more-principled statistical procedures and, in some cases, even outperforms them. We illustrate the utility of our method using human immunodeficiency virus, feline panleukopenia and canine parvovirus evolution examples.

Here we report the crystal structure of EBOV GP in its trimeric, pre-fusion conformation (GP1+GP2) bound to a neutralizing antibody, KZ52, derived from a human survivor of the 1995 Kikwit outbreak. Three GP1 viral attachment subunits assemble to form a chalice, cradled by the GP2 fusion subunits, while a novel glycan cap and projected mucin-like domain restrict access to the conserved receptor-binding site sequestered in the chalice bowl. The glycocalyx surrounding GP is likely central to immune evasion and may explain why survivors have insignificant neutralizing antibody titres. KZ52 recognizes a protein epitope at the chalice base where it clamps several regions of the pre-fusion GP2 to the amino terminus of GP1. This structure provides a template for unravelling the mechanism of EBOV GP-mediated fusion and for future immunotherapeutic development.},

Sequence analysis of the recombinant junctions of 13 nonsibling intertypic recombinants showed that intertypic RNA recombination is not site-specific, nor does it require extensive homology between the recombining parents at the crossover site. To discriminate between breaking-rejoining and copy choice mechanisms of RNA recombination, we have inhibited the replication of the recombining parents independently and found opposite effects on the frequency of genetic recombination in intratypic crosses.

	Abstract = {We have previously shown the presence of multiple small leader-containing RNA species in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-infected cells. In this paper, we have analyzed the origin, structure, and mechanism of synthesis of these small RNAs. Using cDNA probes specific for leader RNA and genes A, D, and F, we demonstrate that subsets of these small RNAs were derived from the various viral genes. These subsets have discrete and reproducible sizes, varying with the gene from which they are derived. The size of each subset correlates with regions of secondary structure, whose free energy ranges from −1.6 to −77.1 kcal/mol, in each of the mRNAs examined. In addition, identical subsets were detected on the replicative intermediate (RI) RNA, suggesting that they represent functional transcriptional intermediates. The biological significance of these small RNAs is further supported by the detection of leader-containing RNAs of 47, 50, and 57 nucleotides in length, which correspond to the crossover sites in two MHV recombinant viruses. These data, coupled with the high frequency of RNA recombination during MHV infection, suggest that the viral polymerase may pause in or around regions of secondary structure, thereby generating pools of free leader-containing RNA intermediates which can reassociate with the template, acting as primers for the synthesis of full-length or recombinant RNAs. These data suggest that MHV transcription uses a discontinuous and nonprocessive mechanism in which RNA polymerase allows the partial RNA products to be dissociated from the template temporarily during the process of transcription.},

	Abstract = {Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus (belonging to the Filoviridae family) emerged four decades ago and cause epidemics of haemorrhagic fever with high case-fatality rates. The genome of filoviruses encodes seven proteins. No significant homology is observed between filovirus proteins and any known macromolecule. Moreover, Marburgvirus and Ebolavirus show significant differences in protein homology. The natural maintenance cycle of filoviruses is unknown, the natural reservoir, the mode of transmission, the epidemic disease generation, and temporal dynamics are unclear. Lastly, Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus are considered as potential biological weapons. Vaccine appears the unique therapeutic frontier. Here, molecular and clinical aspects of filoviral haemorrhagic fevers are summarized.},

Virus RNA could be detected for up to 33 days in vaginal, rectal, and conjunctival swabs of 1 patient and up to 101 days in the seminal fluid of 4 patients. Infectious virus was detected in 1 seminal fluid sample obtained 82 days after disease onset. Sequence analysis of an RT-PCR fragment of the most variable region of the glycoprotein gene amplified from 9 patients revealed no nucleotide changes. The patient samples were selected so that they would include some from a suspected line of transmission with at least three human-to-human passages, some from 5 survivors and 4 deceased patients, and 2 from patients who provided multiple samples through convalescence. There was no evidence of different virus variants cocirculating during the outbreak or of genetic variation accumulating during human-to-human passage or during prolonged persistence in individual patients.},

@article{hoenen_2015,
	Abstract = {The occurrence of Ebola virus (EBOV) in West Africa during 2013--2015 is unprecedented. Early reports suggested that in this outbreak EBOV is mutating twice as fast as previously observed, which indicates the potential for changes in transmissibility and virulence and could render current molecular diagnostics and countermeasures ineffective. We have determined additional full-length sequences from two clusters of imported EBOV infections into Mali, and we show that the nucleotide substitution rate (9.6 × 10--4 substitutions per site per year) is consistent with rates observed in Central African outbreaks. In addition, overall variation among all genotypes observed remains low. Thus, our data indicate that EBOV is not undergoing rapid evolution in humans during the current outbreak. This finding has important implications for outbreak response and public health decisions and should alleviate several previously raised concerns.
Evolution in the Ebola virus outbreak
Has rapid mutation produced alarming new virus characteristics in the 2013--2015 Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa? Hoenen et al. sequenced isolates obtained 9 months into the epidemic from cases in Mali. The nucleotide substitution rate was consistent with rates estimated from past Central African outbreaks. In contrast, analysis of sequence data from early in the outbreak indicated rapid mutation. This more recent finding offers confidence that diagnostic methods, vaccines, and other treatment interventions will remain effective. Nevertheless, vigilance must be maintained: A few mutations can radically change the biological properties of other RNA viruses.

	Abstract = {A multiple sequence alignment program, MAFFT, has been developed. The CPU time is drastically reduced as compared with existing methods. MAFFT includes two novel techniques. (i) Homo logous regions are rapidly identified by the fast Fourier transform (FFT), in which an amino acid sequence is converted to a sequence composed of volume and polarity values of each amino acid residue. (ii) We propose a simplified scoring system that performs well for reducing CPU time and increasing the accuracy of alignments even for sequences having large insertions or extensions as well as distantly related sequences of similar length. Two different heuristics, the progressive method (FFT‐NS‐2) and the iterative refinement method (FFT‐NS‐i), are implemented in MAFFT. The performances of FFT‐NS‐2 and FFT‐NS‐i were compared with other methods by computer simulations and benchmark tests; the CPU time of FFT‐NS‐2 is drastically reduced as compared with CLUSTALW with comparable accuracy. FFT‐NS‐i is over 100 times faster than T‐COFFEE, when the number of input sequences exceeds 60, without sacrificing the accuracy.},

The structure of 14G7 in complex with its linear peptide epitope has now been determined to 2.8 {\AA}. The structure shows that this GP sequence forms a tandem β-hairpin structure that binds deeply into a cleft in the antibody-combining site. A key threonine at the apex of one turn is critical for antibody interaction and is conserved among all Ebola viruses. This work provides further insight into the mechanism of protection by antibodies that target the protruding, highly accessible mucin-like domain of Ebola virus and the structural framework for understanding and characterizing candidate immunotherapeutics.},

	Abstract = {The evolutionary interaction between influenza A virus and the human immune system, manifest as 'antigenic drift' of the viral haemagglutinin, is one of the best described patterns in molecular evolution. However, little is known about the genome-scale evolutionary dynamics of this pathogen. Similarly, how genomic processes relate to global influenza epidemiology, in which the A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 subtypes co-circulate, is poorly understood. Here through an analysis of 1,302 complete viral genomes sampled from temperate populations in both hemispheres, we show that the genomic evolution of influenza A virus is characterized by a complex interplay between frequent reassortment and periodic selective sweeps. The A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 subtypes exhibit different evolutionary dynamics, with diverse lineages circulating in A/H1N1, indicative of weaker antigenic drift. These results suggest a sink--source model of viral ecology in which new lineages are seeded from a persistent influenza reservoir, which we hypothesize to be located in the tropics, to sink populations in temperate regions.},

	Abstract = {We surveyed the genetic diversity among avian influenza virus (AIV) in wild birds, comprising 167 complete viral genomes from 14 bird species sampled in four locations across the United States. These isolates represented 29 type A influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) subtype combinations, with up to 26\% of isolates showing evidence of mixed subtype infection. Through a phylogenetic analysis of the largest data set of AIV genomes compiled to date, we were able to document a remarkably high rate of genome reassortment, with no clear pattern of gene segment association and occasional inter-hemisphere gene segment migration and reassortment. From this, we propose that AIV in wild birds forms transient ``genome constellations,'' continually reshuffled by reassortment, in contrast to the spread of a limited number of stable genome constellations that characterizes the evolution of mammalian-adapted influenza A viruses., Influenza A viruses are an extremely divergent group of RNA viruses that infect in a variety of warm-blooded animals, including birds, horses, pigs, and humans. Since they contain a segmented RNA genome, mixed infection can lead to genetic reassortment. It is thought that the natural reservoir of influenza A viruses is the wild bird population. Influenza A viruses can switch hosts and cause novel outbreaks in new species. Influenza viruses containing genes derived from bird influenza viruses caused the last three influenza pandemics in humans. In this study, we surveyed the genetic diversity among influenza A viruses in wild birds. Through a phylogenetic analysis of the largest data set of wild bird influenza genomes compiled to date, we were able to document a remarkably high rate of genome reassortment, with no clear pattern of gene segment association and occasional inter-hemisphere gene segment migration and reassortment.

Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 6(6), 404--416. Background  The recent emergence of the 2009 pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus has highlighted the value of free and open access to influenza virus genome sequence data integrated with information about other important virus characteristics. Design  The Influenza Research Database (IRD, http://www.fludb.org) is a free, open, publicly-accessible resource funded by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases through the Bioinformatics Resource Centers program. IRD provides a comprehensive, integrated database and analysis resource for influenza sequence, surveillance, and research data, including user-friendly interfaces for data retrieval, visualization and comparative genomics analysis, together with personal log in-protected `workbench' spaces for saving data sets and analysis results. IRD integrates genomic, proteomic, immune epitope, and surveillance data from a variety of sources, including public databases, computational algorithms, external research groups, and the scientific literature. Results  To demonstrate the utility of the data and analysis tools available in IRD, two scientific use cases are presented. A comparison of hemagglutinin sequence conservation and epitope coverage information revealed highly conserved protein regions that can be recognized by the human adaptive immune system as possible targets for inducing cross-protective immunity. Phylogenetic and geospatial analysis of sequences from wild bird surveillance samples revealed a possible evolutionary connection between influenza virus from Delaware Bay shorebirds and Alberta ducks. Conclusions  The IRD provides a wealth of integrated data and information about influenza virus to support research of the genetic determinants dictating virus pathogenicity, host range restriction and transmission, and to facilitate development of vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics.},

Elements of the algorithm include fast distance estimation using kmer counting, progressive alignment using a new profile function we call the log‐expectation score, and refinement using tree‐dependent restricted partitioning. The speed and accuracy of MUSCLE are compared with T‐Coffee, MAFFT and CLUSTALW on four test sets of reference alignments: BAliBASE, SABmark, SMART and a new benchmark, PREFAB. MUSCLE achieves the highest, or joint highest, rank in accuracy on each of these sets. Without refinement, MUSCLE achieves average accuracy statistically indistinguishable from T‐Coffee and MAFFT, and is the fastest of the tested methods for large numbers of sequences, aligning 5000 sequences of average length 350 in 7 min on a current desktop computer.

	Abstract = {The tick-borne Thogoto virus (THOV) is the type species of a newly recognized fourth genus, Thogotovirus, in the family Orthomyxoviridae. Because of the distant relationship of THOV with the influenza viruses, determination of its genomic information can potentially be used to identify important domains in influenza virus proteins. We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the second longest RNA segment of THOV. The molecule comprises 2212 nucleotides with a single large open reading frame encoding a protein of 710 amino acids, estimated Mr 81 284. The protein shares 77\% amino acid similarity with the PB1-like protein of Dhori virus, a related tick-borne virus, and 50--53\% with the PB1 polymerase proteins of influenza virus A, B and C. All the motifs characteristic of RNA-dependent polymerases were identified including the SSDD motif common to all RNA-dependant RNA polymerases, indicating that the THOV protein is functionally analogous to the influenza virus PB1 proteins and involved in chain elongation. We also report the corrected sequence of the third longest RNA segment of THOV, encoding a protein which shares 44--47\% amino acid similarity with the PA-like polymerase proteins of influenza virus A, B and C. The biological significance of conserved domains in these orthomyxovirid proteins is discussed.},

	Abstract = {The infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) is an orthomyxovirus-like virus infecting teleosts. The disease caused by this virus has had major economic consequences for the Atlantic salmon farming industry in Norway, Canada, and Scotland. In this work, we report the cloning and sequencing of an ISAV-specific cDNA comprising 2,245 bp with an open reading frame coding for a predicted protein with a calculated molecular weight of 80.5 kDa. The putative protein sequence shows the core polymerase motifs characteristic of all viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Comparison of the conserved motifs with the corresponding regions of other segmented negative-stranded RNA viruses shows a closer relationship with members of the Orthomyxoviridae than with viruses in other families. The putative ISAV polymerase protein (PB1) has a length of 708 amino acids, a charge of +22 at neutral pH, and a pI of 9.9, which are consistent with the properties of the PB1 proteins of other members of the family. Calculations of the distances between the different PB1 proteins indicate that the ISAV is distantly related to the other members of the family but more closely related to the influenza viruses than to the Thogoto viruses. Based on these and previously published results, we propose that the ISAV comprises a new, fifth genus in the Orthomyxoviridae.},

@article{ran_2015,
	Abstract = {Influenza B virus (IBV) causes seasonal epidemics in humans. Although IBV has been isolated from seals, humans are considered the primary host and reservoir of this important pathogen. It is unclear whether other animal species can support the replication of IBV and serve as a reservoir. Swine are naturally infected with both influenza A and C viruses. To determine the susceptibility of pigs to IBV infection, we conducted a serological survey for U.S. Midwest domestic swine herds from 2010 to 2012. Results of this study showed that antibodies to IBVs were detected in 38.5\% (20/52) of sampled farms, and 7.3\% (41/560) of tested swine serum samples were positive for IBV antibodies. Furthermore, swine herds infected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) showed a higher prevalence of IBV antibodies in our 2014 survey. In addition, IBV was detected in 3 nasal swabs collected from PRRSV-seropositive pigs by real-time RT-PCR and sequencing. Finally, an experimental infection in pigs, via intranasal and intratracheal routes, was performed using one representative virus from each of the two genetically and antigenically distinct lineages of IBVs: B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria lineage) and B/Yamagata/16/1988 (Yamagata lineage). Pigs developed influenza-like symptoms and lung lesions, and they seroconverted after virus inoculation. Pigs infected with B/Brisbane/60/2008 virus successfully transmitted the virus to sentinel animals. Taken together, our data demonstrate that pigs are susceptible to IBV infection; therefore, they warrant further surveillance and investigation of swine as a potential host for human IBV.
IMPORTANCE IBV is an important human pathogen, but its ability to infect other species, for example, pigs, is not well understood. We showed serological evidence that antibodies to two genetically and antigenically distinct lineages of IBVs were present among domestic pigs, especially in swine herds previously infected with PRRSV, an immunosuppressive virus. IBV was detected in 3 nasal swabs from PRRSV-seropositive pigs by real-time reverse transcription-PCR and sequencing. Moreover, both lineages of IBV were able to infect pigs under experimental conditions, with transmissibility of influenza B/Victoria lineage virus among pigs being observed. Our results demonstrate that pigs are susceptible to IBV infections, indicating that IBV is a swine pathogen, and swine may serve as a natural reservoir of IBVs. In addition, pigs may serve as a model to study the mechanisms of transmission and pathogenesis of IBVs.},

	Abstract = {Arboviral infections are an important cause of emerging infections due to the movements of humans, animals, and hematophagous arthropods. Quaranfil virus (QRFV) is an unclassified arbovirus originally isolated from children with mild febrile illness in Quaranfil, Egypt, in 1953. It has subsequently been isolated in multiple geographic areas from ticks and birds. We used high-throughput sequencing to classify QRFV as a novel orthomyxovirus. The genome of this virus is comprised of multiple RNA segments; five were completely sequenced. Proteins with limited amino acid similarity to conserved domains in polymerase (PA, PB1, and PB2) and hemagglutinin (HA) genes from known orthomyxoviruses were predicted to be present in four of the segments. The fifth sequenced segment shared no detectable similarity to any protein and is of uncertain function. The end-terminal sequences of QRFV are conserved between segments and are different from those of the known orthomyxovirus genera. QRFV is known to cross-react serologically with two other unclassified viruses, Johnston Atoll virus (JAV) and Lake Chad virus (LKCV). The complete open reading frames of PB1 and HA were sequenced for JAV, while a fragment of PB1 of LKCV was identified by mass sequencing. QRFV and JAV PB1 and HA shared 80\% and 70\% amino acid identity to each other, respectively; the LKCV PB1 fragment shared 83\% amino acid identity with the corresponding region of QRFV PB1. Based on phylogenetic analyses, virion ultrastructural features, and the unique end-terminal sequences identified, we propose that QRFV, JAV, and LKCV comprise a novel genus of the family Orthomyxoviridae.},

	Abstract = {The study of rates of nucleotide substitution in RNA viruses is central to our understanding of their evolution. Herein we report a comprehensive analysis of substitution rates in 50 RNA viruses using a recently developed maximum likelihood phylogenetic method. This analysis revealed a significant relationship between genetic divergence and isolation time for an extensive array of RNA viruses, although more rate variation was usually present among lineages than would be expected under the constraints of a molecular clock. Despite the lack of a molecular clock, the range of statistically significant variation in overall substitution rates was surprisingly narrow for those viruses where a significant relationship between genetic divergence and time was found, as was the case when synonymous sites were considered alone, where the molecular clock was rejected less frequently. An analysis of the ecological and genetic factors that might explain this rate variation revealed some evidence of significantly lower substitution rates in vector-borne viruses, as well as a weak correlation between rate and genome length. Finally, a simulation study revealed that our maximum likelihood estimates of substitution rates are valid, even if the molecular clock is rejected, provided that sufficiently large data sets are analyzed.},

I give an overview of our current knowledge of the genetic diversity of human viruses using comparative studies of viral populations, particularly those with RNA genomes, to highlight important generalities in the patterns and processes of viral evolution. Special emphasis is given to the major dichotomy between RNA and DNA viruses in their epidemiological dynamics and the different types of phylogeographic pattern exhibited by human viruses. I also consider a central paradox in studies of viral evolution: Although epidemiological theory predicts that RNA viruses have ancestries dating back millennia, with major ecological transitions facilitating their emergence, the genetic diversity in currently circulating viral populations has a far more recent ancestry, indicative of continual lineage turnover.},

	Abstract = {Spatio-temporal travelling waves are striking manifestations of predator--prey and host--parasite dynamics. However, few systems are well enough documented both to detect repeated waves and to explain their interaction with spatio-temporal variations in population structure and demography. Here, we demonstrate recurrent epidemic travelling waves in an exhaustive spatio-temporal data set for measles in England and Wales. We use wavelet phase analysis, which allows for dynamical non-stationarity---a complication in interpreting spatio-temporal patterns in these and many other ecological time series. In the pre-vaccination era, conspicuous hierarchical waves of infection moved regionally from large cities to small towns; the introduction of measles vaccination restricted but did not eliminate this hierarchical contagion. A mechanistic stochastic model suggests a dynamical explanation for the waves---spread via infective 'sparks' from large 'core' cities to smaller 'satellite' towns. Thus, the spatial hierarchy of host population structure is a prerequisite for these infection waves.},

	Abstract = {Background. Information on measles vaccine effectiveness (VE) is critical to help inform policies for future global measles control goals.
Methods. We reviewed results of VE studies published during 1960--2010.
Results. Seventy papers with 135 VE point estimates were identified. For a single dose of vaccine administered at 9--11 months of age and ≥12 months, the median VE was 77.0\% (interquartile range [IQR], 62\%--91\%) and 92.0\% (IQR, 86\%--96\%), respectively. When analysis was restricted to include only point estimates for which vaccination history was verified and cases were laboratory confirmed, the median VE was 84.0\% (IQR, 72.0\%--95.0\%) and 92.5\% (IQR, 84.8\%--97.0\%) when vaccine was received at 9--11 and ≥12 months, respectively. Published VE vary by World Health Organization region, with generally lower estimates in countries belonging to the African and SouthEast Asian Regions. For 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine, compared with no vaccination, the median VE was 94.1\% (IQR, 88.3\%--98.3\%).
Conclusions. The VE of the first dose of measles-containing vaccine administered at 9--11 months was lower than what would be expected from serologic evaluations but was higher than expected when administered at ≥12 months. The median VE increased in a subset of articles in which classification bias was reduced through verified vaccination history and laboratory confirmation. In general, 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine provided excellent protection against measles.},

	Abstract = {The glycoprotein coding sequences from three wild-type measles viruses isolated in the United States during 1988--1989 were examined by mRNA templated sequencing to determine whether contemporary strains have undergone genetic changes relative to the vaccine strain, Moraten. These studies revealed variation in the hemagglutinin (HA) gene and, to a far lesser degree, the fusion (F) gene. The F protein coding region was highly conserved with only three predicted amino acid changes. Among the predicted amino acid changes identified in the HA was a new potential glycosylation site at residue 416, located toward the carboxy-terminal end of the HA peptide. Eighty percent of the predicted amino acid changes in the HA shared by the three wild-type isolates were clustered near the five previously identified potential glycosylation sites. A linear pattern of evolutionary change was observed after comparing the predicted amino acid HA changes from the 1988--1989 viruses to those predicted in the HA protein from U.S. wild types isolated in 1977 and 1983.},

Changes in the genes accumulate with time, and an evolutionary tree based on the maximum parsimony method can be constructed. The evolutionary rate is approximately 2 X 10(-3) substitution per site per year in the NS genes, which is about 10(6) times the evolutionary rate of germline genes in mammals. This uniform and rapid rate of evolution in the NS gene is a good molecular clock and is compatible with the hypothesis that positive selection is operating on the hemagglutinin (or perhaps some other viral genes) to preserve random mutations in the NS gene.},

	Abstract = {Bats have been identified as the natural reservoir of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like and SARS coronaviruses (SLCoV and SCoV). However, previous studies suggested that none of the currently sampled bat SLCoVs is the descendant of the direct ancestor of SCoV, based on their relatively distant phylogenetic relationship. In this study, evidence of the recombinant origin of the genome of a bat SLCoV is demonstrated. We identified a potential recombination breakpoint immediately after the consensus intergenic sequence between open reading frame 1 and the S coding region, suggesting the replication intermediates may participate in the recombination event, as previously speculated for other CoVs. Phylogenetic analysis of its parental regions suggests the presence of an uncharacterized SLCoV lineage that is phylogenetically closer to SCoVs than any of the currently sampled bat SLCoVs. Using various Bayesian molecular-clock models, interspecies transfer of this SLCoV lineage from bats to the amplifying host (e.g., civets) was estimated to have happened a median of 4.08 years before the SARS outbreak. Based on this relatively short window period, we speculate that this uncharacterized SLCoV lineage may contain the direct ancestor of SCoV. This study sheds light on the possible host bat species of the direct ancestor of SCoV, providing valuable information on the scope and focus of surveillance for the origin of SCoV.},

Of 1,401 Chinese horseshoe bats from Hong Kong and Guangdong, China, that were sampled, SARSr-Rh-BatCoV was detected in alimentary specimens from 130 (9.3\%) bats, with peak activity during spring. A tagging exercise of 511 bats showed migration distances from 1.86 to 17 km. Bats carrying SARSr-Rh-BatCoV appeared healthy, with viral clearance occurring between 2 weeks and 4 months. However, lower body weights were observed in bats positive for SARSr-Rh-BatCoV, but not Rh-BatCoV HKU2. Complete genome sequencing of 10 SARSr-Rh-BatCoV strains showed frequent recombination between different strains. Moreover, recombination was detected between SARSr-Rh-BatCoV Rp3 from Guangxi, China, and Rf1 from Hubei, China, in the possible generation of civet SARSr-CoV SZ3, with a breakpoint at the nsp16/spike region. Molecular clock analysis showed that SARSr-CoVs were newly emerged viruses with the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) at 1972, which diverged between civet and bat strains in 1995. The present data suggest that SARSr-Rh-BatCoV causes acute, self-limiting infection in horseshoe bats, which serve as a reservoir for recombination between strains from different geographical locations within reachable foraging range. Civet SARSr-CoV is likely a recombinant virus arising from SARSr-CoV strains closely related to SARSr-Rh-BatCoV Rp3 and Rf1. Such frequent recombination, coupled with rapid evolution especially in ORF7b/ORF8 region, in these animals may have accounted for the cross-species transmission and emergence of SARS.},

	Abstract = {In the early 1970s, a human influenza A/Port Chalmers/1/73 (H3N2)-like virus colonized the European swine population. Analyses of swine influenza A (H3N2) viruses isolated in The Netherlands and Belgium revealed that in the early 1990s, antigenic drift had occurred, away from A/Port Chalmers/1/73, the strain commonly used in influenza vaccines for pigs. Here we show that Italian swine influenza A (H3N2) viruses displayed antigenic and genetic changes similar to those observed in Northern European viruses in the same period. We used antigenic cartography methods for quantitative analyses of the antigenic evolution of European swine H3N2 viruses and observed a clustered virus evolution as seen for human viruses. Although the antigenic drift of swine and human H3N2 viruses has followed distinct evolutionary paths, potential cluster-differentiating amino acid substitutions in the influenza virus surface protein hemagglutinin (HA) were in part the same. The antigenic evolution of swine viruses occurred at a rate approximately six times slower than the rate in human viruses, even though the rates of genetic evolution of the HA at the nucleotide and amino acid level were similar for human and swine H3N2 viruses. Continuous monitoring of antigenic changes is recommended to give a first indication as to whether vaccine strains may need updating. Our data suggest that humoral immunity in the population plays a smaller role in the evolutionary selection processes of swine H3N2 viruses than in human H3N2 viruses.},

@article{collin_2015,
	Abstract = {Viruses with approximately 50\% homology to human influenza C virus (ICV) have recently been isolated from swine and cattle. The overall low homology to ICV, lack of antibody cross-reactivity to ICV in hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and agar gel immunodiffusion assays, and inability to productively reassort with ICV led to the proposal that these viruses represented a new genus of influenza virus, influenzavirus D (IDV). To further our understanding of the epidemiology of IDV, real-time reverse transcription-PCR was performed on a set of 208 samples from bovines with respiratory disease. Ten samples (4.8\%) were positive and six viruses were successfully isolated in vitro. Phylogenetic analysis of full-genome sequences of these six new viruses and four previously reported viruses revealed two distinct cocirculating lineages represented by D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (D/OK) and D/bovine/Oklahoma/660/2013 (D/660), which frequently reassorted with one another. Antigenic analysis using the HI assay and lineage-representative D/OK and D/660 antiserum found up to an approximate 10-fold loss in cross-reactivity against heterologous clade antiserum. One isolate, D/bovine/Texas/3-13/2011 (D/3-13), clustered with the D/660 lineage, but also had high HI titers to heterologous (D/OK) clade antiserum. Molecular modeling of the hemagglutinin esterase fusion protein of D/3-13 identified a mutation at position 212 as a possible antigenic determinant responsible for the discrepant HI results. These results suggest that IDV is common in bovines with respiratory disease and that at least two genetic and antigenically distinct clades cocirculate.
IMPORTANCE: A novel bovine influenza virus was recently identified. Detailed genetic and antigenic studies led to the proposal that this virus represents a new genus of influenza, influenzavirus D (IDV). Here, we show that IDV is common in clinical samples of bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC), with a prevalence similar to that of other established BRDC etiological agents. These results are in good agreement with the near-ubiquitous seroprevalence of IDV previously found. Phylogenetic analysis of complete genome sequences found evidence for two distinct cocirculating lineages of IDV which freely reassort. Significant antigenic differences, which generally agreed with the surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin esterase phylogeny, were observed between the two lineages. Based on these results, and on the ability of IDV to infect and transmit in multiple mammalian species, additional studies to determine the pathogenic potential of IDV are warranted.},

	Abstract = {We have recently reported the isolation of a novel virus, provisionally designated C/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (C/OK), with 50\% overall homology to human influenza C viruses (ICV), from a pig in Oklahoma. Deep RNA sequencing of C/OK virus found a matrix 1 (M1) protein expression strategy that differed from that of ICV. The novelty of C/OK virus prompted us to investigate whether C/OK virus could exist in a nonswine species. Significantly, we found that C/OK virus was widespread in U.S. bovine herds, as demonstrated by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and serological assays. Genome sequencing of three bovine viruses isolated from two herds in different states further confirmed these findings. To determine whether swine/bovine C/OK viruses can undergo reassortment with human ICV, and to clarify the taxonomic status of C/OK, in vitro reassortment and serological typing by agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) were conducted. In vitro reassortment using two human ICV and two swine and bovine C/OK viruses demonstrated that human ICV and C/OK viruses were unable to reassort and produce viable progeny. Antigenically, no cross-recognition of detergent split virions was observed in AGID between human and nonhuman viruses by using polyclonal antibodies that were reactive to cognate antigens. Taken together, these results demonstrate that C/OK virus is genetically and antigenically distinct from ICV. The classification of the new virus in a separate genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family is proposed. The finding of C/OK virus in swine and bovine indicates that this new virus may spread and establish infection in other mammals, including humans.
IMPORTANCE Influenza C viruses (ICV) are common human pathogens, infecting most people during childhood and adolescence, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms. While ICV have been isolated from both pigs and dogs, humans are thought to be the natural viral reservoir. Previously, we characterized an ICV-like virus isolated from pigs exhibiting symptoms of influenza virus-like illness. Here, we show molecular and serological data demonstrating widespread circulation of similar viruses in bovines. Deep RNA sequencing, phylogenetic analysis, and in vitro reassortment experiments demonstrate that animal ICV-like viruses are genetically distinct from human ICV. Antigenically, we show that ICV-like viruses are not recognized by ICV antibodies. En masse, these results suggest that bovine influenza virus warrants classification as a new genus of influenza virus. The finding of this novel virus that can infect multiple mammalian species warrants further research into its role in human health.},

	Abstract = {Of the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses, only influenza A viruses are thought to exist as multiple subtypes and has non-human maintenance hosts. In April 2011, nasal swabs were collected for virus isolation from pigs exhibiting influenza-like illness. Subsequent electron microscopic, biochemical, and genetic studies identified an orthomyxovirus with seven RNA segments exhibiting approximately 50\% overall amino acid identity to human influenza C virus. Based on its genetic organizational similarities to influenza C viruses this virus has been provisionally designated C/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (C/OK). Phylogenetic analysis of the predicted viral proteins found that the divergence between C/OK and human influenza C viruses was similar to that observed between influenza A and B viruses. No cross reactivity was observed between C/OK and human influenza C viruses using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays. Additionally, screening of pig and human serum samples found that 9.5\% and 1.3\%, respectively, of individuals had measurable HI antibody titers to C/OK virus. C/OK virus was able to infect both ferrets and pigs and transmit to naive animals by direct contact. Cell culture studies showed that C/OK virus displayed a broader cellular tropism than a human influenza C virus. The observed difference in cellular tropism was further supported by structural analysis showing that hemagglutinin esterase (HE) proteins between two viruses have conserved enzymatic but divergent receptor-binding sites. These results suggest that C/OK virus represents a new subtype of influenza C viruses that currently circulates in pigs that has not been recognized previously. The presence of multiple subtypes of co-circulating influenza C viruses raises the possibility of reassortment and antigenic shift as mechanisms of influenza C virus evolution.},

	Abstract = {During the 2001--2002 influenza season, virological surveillance highlighted the predominant circulation of B viruses (86\% of isolates) in Italy, in contrast to many other countries in Europe and North America where {AH3N2} viruses were isolated most frequently, and in contrast to the infrequent isolation of B viruses in Italy during the previous two years. Associated with this predominance of influenza B was the re-emergence of {B/Victoria/2/87-lineage} viruses, closely related to B viruses prevalent during the 1980s, which are distinct antigenically and genetically from circulating {B/Sichuan/379/99-like} viruses of the {B/Yamagata/16/88} lineage, which predominated in most parts of the world during the last 10 years. Ninety-four viruses isolated in two regions of northern Italy were characterized, 50 by direct sequencing of haemagglutinin ({HA).} Viruses of both Victoria and Yamagata lineages co-circulated throughout the 12 weeks of the influenza season. The {HAs} of the Yamagata-lineage viruses were heterogeneous and comprised two sublineages, represented by {B/Sichuan/379/99} and {B/Harbin/7/94}, whereas the Victoria-lineage viruses were more homogeneous and closely related to {B/Hong} Kong/330/01, the current prototype vaccine strain. The antigenic and genetic characteristics of the viruses correlated with certain epidemiological features. In particular, the low age ({\textless}14 years) of individuals infected with {B/Hong} Kong/330/01-like viruses is likely to reflect the greater susceptibility of the youngest cohort, due to lack of previous exposure to Victoria-lineage viruses, and is consistent with the conclusion that vaccination with a {B/Sichuan/379/99-like} virus would give poor protection against infection with {B/Hong} Kong/330/01-like (Victoria-lineage) viruses.

	Abstract = {From 2000 to 2002, human influenza A and B viruses that were genetic reassortants of contemporary circulating human strains, were isolated in South East Asia and Oceania. Similar to reports from other regions, A({H1N2)} isolates were found to be reassortants of circulating A({H3N2)} viruses that had acquired only the haeamagglutinin gene of an A({H1N1)} virus. Some of these reassortants from Thailand and Singapore predate those previously recorded during the winter of 2001--2002 in Europe and the Middle East and may be precursors of these viruses. The B reassortants had a haemagglutinin similar to an earlier B strain, {B/Shangdong/7/97} ({B/Victoria/2/87-lineage)} and a neuraminidase similar to the recently circulating {B/Sichuan/379/99} virus ({B/Yamagata/16/88-lineage).} Despite the early occurrences of A({H1N2)} reassortants and the extensive circulation of A(H1) viruses in South East Asia and Oceania during 2000--2001, these reassortant influenza A viruses have to date not been prominent unlike Europe and the Middle East where they were common in the 2001--2002 winter. In contrast the reassortant B viruses, which first emerged in this region in early 2002, rapidly became the predominant strains isolated from patients with influenza B in South East Asia and Oceania.},

	Abstract = {{RNA} viruses evolve extremely quickly, allowing them to rapidly adapt to new environmental conditions. Viral pathogens, such as influenza virus, exploit this capacity for evolutionary change to persist within the human population despite substantial immune pressure. Understanding the process of adaptation in these viral systems is essential to our efforts to combat infectious disease.

@article{bedford_2014,
	Abstract = {Every year, seasonal influenza, commonly called flu, infects up to one in five people around the world, and causes up to half a million deaths. Even though the human immune system can detect and destroy the virus that causes influenza, people can catch flu many times throughout their lifetimes because the virus keeps evolving in an effort to avoid the immune system. This antigenic drift---so-called because the antigens displayed by the virus keep changing---also explains why influenza vaccines become less effective over time and need to be reformulated every year.

It is possible to determine which antigens are displayed by a new strain of the virus by observing how blood samples that respond to known strains respond to the new strain. This information about the ``antigenic phenotype'' of the virus can be plotted on an antigenic map in which strains with similar antigens cluster together. Gene sequencing has shown that there are four subtypes of the flu virus that commonly infect people; but the relationship between changes in antigenic phenotype and changes in gene sequences of the influenza virus is poorly understood.

Bedford et al. have now developed an approach to combine antigenic maps with genetic information about the four subtypes of the human flu virus. This revealed that the antigenic phenotype of {H3N2---a} subtype that is becoming increasingly common---evolved faster than the other three subtypes. Further, a correlation was observed between antigenic drift and the number of new influenza cases per year for each flu strain. This suggests that knowing which antigenic phenotypes are present at the start of flu season could help predict which strains of the virus will predominate later on.

The work of Bedford et al. provides a useful framework to study influenza, and could help to pinpoint which changes in viral genes cause the changes in antigens. This information could potentially speed up the development of new flu vaccines for each flu season.

	Abstract = {To determine the extent of homologous recombination in human influenza A virus, we assembled a data set of 13,852 sequences representing all eight segments and both major circulating subtypes, {H3N2} and {H1N1.} Using an exhaustive search and a nonparametric test for mosaic structure, we identified 315 sequences (∼2\%) in five different {RNA} segments that, after a multiple-comparison correction, had statistically significant mosaic signals compatible with homologous recombination. Of these, only two contained recombinant regions of sufficient length ({\textgreater}100 nucleotides [nt]) that the occurrence of homologous recombination could be verified using phylogenetic methods, with the rest involving very short sequence regions (15 to 30 nt). Although this secondary analysis revealed patterns of phylogenetic incongruence compatible with the action of recombination, neither candidate recombinant was strongly supported. Given our inability to exclude the occurrence of mixed infection and template switching during amplification, laboratory artifacts provide an alternative and likely explanation for the occurrence of phylogenetic incongruence in these two cases. We therefore conclude that, if it occurs at all, homologous recombination plays only a very minor role in the evolution of human influenza A virus.},

	Abstract = {Influenza A viruses from wild aquatic birds, their natural reservoir species, are thought to have reached a form of stasis, characterized by low rates of evolutionary change. We tested this hypothesis by estimating rates of nucleotide substitution in a diverse array of avian influenza viruses ({AIV)} and allowing for rate variation among lineages. The rates observed were extremely high, at {\textgreater}10−3 substitutions per site, per year, with little difference among wild and domestic host species or viral subtypes and were similar to those seen in mammalian influenza A viruses. Influenza A virus therefore exhibits rapid evolutionary dynamics across its host range, consistent with a high background mutation rate and rapid replication. Using the same approach, we also estimated that the common ancestors of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase sequences of {AIV} arose within the last 3,000 years, with most intrasubtype diversity emerging within the last 100 years and suggestive of a continual selective turnover.},

However, it remains unknown when, where, and how this {HA} lineage emerged in the world. In this study, the {HA1} domain of the {HA} gene of fourteen influenza B viruses isolated in China in 1972--1984 was sequenced. The sequences were phylogenetically analyzed with the {HA1} sequences of 41 other important influenza B isolates. The results unveiled some earlier footprints of the Victoria lineage in China, and the epidemic history of the Victoria lineage could be traced back from the year 1985 to 1975. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis, the history of China, and the epidemiology of influenza B virus indicated that the Victoria lineage possibly emerged in China in the 1970s through gradual evolution from a minor lineage.},

@article{cobbin_2013,
	Abstract = {The yields of egg-grown influenza vaccines are maximized by the production of a seed strain using a reassortment of the seasonal influenza virus isolate with a highly egg-adapted strain. The seed virus is selected based on high yields of viral hemagglutinin ({HA)} and expression of the surface antigens from the seasonal isolate. The remaining proteins are usually derived from the high-growth parent. However, a retrospective analysis of vaccine seeds revealed that the seasonal {PB1} gene was selected in more than 50\% of reassortment events. Using the model seasonal {H3N2} virus {A/Udorn/307/72} (Udorn) virus and the high-growth {A/Puerto} Rico/8/34 ({PR8)} virus, we assessed the influence of the source of the {PB1} gene on virus growth and vaccine yield. Classical reassortment of these two strains led to the selection of viruses that predominantly had the Udorn {PB1} gene. The presence of Udorn {PB1} in the seed virus, however, did not result in higher yields of virus or {HA} compared to the yields in the corresponding seed virus with {PR8} {PB1.} The 8-fold-fewer virions produced with the seed virus containing the Udorn {PB1} were somewhat compensated for by a 4-fold increase in {HA} per virion. A higher {HA/nucleoprotein} ({NP)} ratio was found in past vaccine preparations when the seasonal {PB1} was present, also indicative of a higher {HA} density in these vaccine viruses. As the {HA} viral {RNA} ({vRNA)} and {mRNA} levels in infected cells were similar, we propose that {PB1} selectively alters the translation of viral {mRNA.} This study helps to explain the variability of vaccine seeds with respect to {HA} yield.},

We have generated green fluorescent protein ({GFP)-tagged} polymerase subunits to study the assembly of the polymerase complex. Our results show that individually expressed polymerase basic protein 1 ({PB1)} and polymerase acidic protein ({PA)} subunits were distributed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, while the polymerase basic protein 2 ({PB2)} subunit accumulated in the nucleus. Although it has been reported that {PB1} alone accumulates in the nucleus, we demonstrate that {PB1} requires the coexpression of {PA} for efficient nuclear accumulation. Our results support a model which proposes that {PB1} and {PA} are transported into the nucleus as a complex.},

	Abstract = {Background
Influenza A virus vaccines undergo yearly reformulations due to the antigenic variability of the virus caused by antigenic drift and shift. It is critical to the vaccine manufacturing process to obtain influenza A seed virus that is antigenically identical to circulating wild type (wt) virus and grows to high titers in embryonated chicken eggs. Inactivated influenza A seasonal vaccines are generated by classical reassortment. The classical method takes advantage of the ability of the influenza virus to reassort based on the segmented nature of its genome. In ovo co-inoculation of a high growth or yield (hy) donor virus and a low yield wt virus with antibody selection against the donor surface antigens results in progeny viruses that grow to high titers in ovo with wt origin hemagglutinin ({HA)} and neuraminidase ({NA)} glycoproteins. In this report we determined the parental origin of the remaining six genes encoding the internal proteins that contribute to the hy phenotype in ovo.


Methodology
The genetic analysis was conducted using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ({RT-PCR)} and restriction fragment length polymorphism ({RFLP).} The characterization was conducted to determine the parental origin of the gene segments (hy donor virus or wt virus), gene segment ratios and constellations. Fold increase in growth of reassortant viruses compared to respective parent wt viruses was determined by hemagglutination assay titers.


Significance
In this study fifty-seven influenza A vaccine candidate reassortants were analyzed for the presence or absence of correlations between specific gene segment ratios, gene constellations and hy reassortant phenotype. We found two gene ratios, 6∶2 and 5∶3, to be the most prevalent among the hy reassortants analyzed, although other gene ratios also conferred hy in certain reassortants.},

	Abstract = {Pandemic influenza has posed an increasing threat to public health worldwide in the last decade. In the 20th century, three human pandemic influenza outbreaks occurred in 1918, 1957 and 1968, causing significant mortality. A number of hypotheses have been proposed for the emergence and development of pandemic viruses, including direct introduction into humans from an avian origin and reassortment between avian and previously circulating human viruses, either directly in humans or via an intermediate mammalian host. However, the evolutionary history of the pandemic viruses has been controversial, largely due to the lack of background genetic information and rigorous phylogenetic analyses. The pandemic that emerged in early April 2009 in North America provides a unique opportunity to investigate its emergence and development both in human and animal aspects. Recent genetic analyses of data accumulated through long-term influenza surveillance provided insights into the emergence of this novel pandemic virus. In this review, we summarise the recent literature that describes the evolutionary pathway of the pandemic viruses. We also discuss the implications of these findings on the early detection and control of future pandemics.},

	Abstract = {Influenza virus {mRNAs} are synthesized by the trimeric viral polymerase using short capped primers obtained by a 'cap-snatching' mechanism. The polymerase {PB2} subunit binds the 5' cap of host pre-{mRNAs}, which are cleaved after 10--13 nucleotides by the {PB1} subunit. Using a library-screening method, we identified an independently folded domain of {PB2} that has specific cap binding activity. The X-ray structure of the domain with bound cap analog {m7GTP} at 2.3-{\AA} resolution reveals a previously unknown fold and a mode of ligand binding that is similar to, but distinct from, other cap binding proteins. Binding and functional studies with point mutants confirm that the identified site is essential for cap binding in vitro and cap-dependent transcription in vivo by the trimeric polymerase complex. These findings clarify the nature of the cap binding site in {PB2} and will allow efficient structure-based design of new anti-influenza compounds inhibiting viral transcription.},

	Abstract = {The evolution of influenza viruses results in (i) recurrent annual epidemics of disease that are caused by progressive antigenic drift of influenza A and B viruses due to the mutability of the {RNA} genome and (ii) infrequent but severe pandemics caused by the emergence of novel influenza A subtypes to which the population has little immunity. The latter characteristic is a consequence of the wide antigenic diversity and peculiar host range of influenza A viruses and the ability of their segmented {RNA} genomes to undergo frequent genetic reassortment (recombination) during mixed infections. Contrasting features of the evolution of recently circulating influenza {AH1N1}, {AH3N2} and B viruses include the rapid drift of {AH3N2} viruses as a single lineage, the slow replacement of successive antigenic variants of {AH1N1} viruses and the co-circulation over some 25 years of antigenically and genetically distinct lineages of influenza B viruses. Constant monitoring of changes in the circulating viruses is important for maintaining the efficacy of influenza vaccines in combating disease.},

Three different measures of disequilibrium with 95\% intervals are tabulated for combinations of n, k, l and {4Nc}, where N is the effective population size and c is the amount of recombination between the loci. The extent and pattern of disequilibrium are strongly dependent upon {4Nc} and are somewhat dependent on n, k and l. The 95\% intervals are large, particularly for low numbers of alleles and low values of {4Nc.} As examples, observed disequilibrium from histocompatibility loci in humans ({HLA)} and electrophoretic data in E. coli and lodgepole pine were compared to these theoretical values.

	Abstract = {Phylogenetic patterns of the three polymerase ({PB2}, {PB1} and {PA)} genes of a total of 20 influenza B viruses isolated during a 58 year period, 1940--1998, were analysed in detail in a parallel manner. All three polymerase genes consistently showed evolutionary divergence into two major distinct lineages and their amino acid profiles demonstrated conserved lineage-specific substitutions. Dendrogram topologies of the {PB2} and {PB1} genes were very similar and contrasted with that of the {PA} gene. It was of particular interest to reveal that even though the {PA} gene evolved into two major lineages, that of three recent Asian Victoria/1/87-like strains formed a branch cluster located in the same lineage as that of recent Yamagata/16/88-like isolates. Differences in the phylogenetic pathways of three polymerase genes were not only a reflection of genetic reassortment between co-circulating influenza B viruses, but also an indication that the polymerase genes were not co-evolving as a unit. As a result, comparison of the phylogenetic patterns of the three polymerase genes with previously determined patterns of the {HA}, {NP}, M and {NS} genes of 18 viruses defined the existence of eight distinct genome constellations. Also, similar phylogenetic profiles among the {PA}, {NP} and M genes, as well as between the {PB2} and {PB1} genes, were observed, suggesting possible functional interactions among these proteins. Completion of evolutionary analysis of the six internal genes and the {HA} gene of influenza B viruses revealed frequent genetic reassortment among co-circulating variable strains and suggested co-dependent evolution of genes.},

	Abstract = {Influenza B virus causes a significant amount of morbidity and mortality, yet the systems to produce high yield inactivated vaccines for these viruses have lagged behind the development of those for influenza A virus. We have established a plasmid-only reverse genetics system for the generation of recombinant influenza B virus that facilitates the generation of vaccine viruses without the need for time consuming coinfection and selection procedures currently required to produce reassortants. We cloned the eight viral {cDNAs} of influenza {B/Yamanashi/166/98}, which yields relatively high titers in embryonated chicken eggs, between {RNA} polymerase I and {RNA} polymerase {II} transcription units. Virus was detected as early as 3 days after transfection of cocultured {COS7} and {Madin--Darby} canine kidney cells and achieved levels of 106-107 plaque-forming units per ml of cell supernatant 6 days after transfection. The full-length sequence of the recombinant virus after passage into embryonated chicken eggs was identical to that of the input plasmids. To improve the utility of the eight-plasmid system for generating 6 + 2 reassortants from recently circulating influenza B strains, we optimized the reverse {transcriptase--PCR} for cloning of the hemagglutinin ({HA)} and neuraminidase ({NA)} segments. The six internal genes of {B/Yamanashi/166/98} were used as the backbone to generate 6 + 2 reassortants including the {HA} and {NA} gene segments from {B/Victoria/504/2000}, {B/Hong} Kong/330/2001, and {B/Hawaii/10/2001.} Our results demonstrate that the eight-plasmid system can be used for the generation of high yields of influenza B virus vaccines expressing current {HA} and {NA} glycoproteins from either of the two lineages of influenza B virus.},

	Abstract = {A new {B/Shangdong/7/97-like} influenza virus (Victoria/2/87 lineage) predominated during the 2002/2003 epidemic season in Finland and was estimated to account for 2246 of the 13,496 feverish upper respiratory tract infections ({URIs)} occurring among conscripts in the Finnish army. The incidence (1716/10,000 conscripts) was indicative of moderate epidemic activity at most. Analysis of the cross-reactive antibodies induced in 1988 suggests that the basis of the protection was probably established during the childhood of the conscripts. Vaccination in autumn 2002 prevented 42\% of the {URIs} during the influenza B outbreak and 71\% (95\% {CI} 42-85) of infections interpreted as influenza B. Despite the low genetic variability of the Shangdong/7/97-like viruses, breakages of a potential glycosylation site in haemagglutinin ({HA1}, position 197) were frequent; their biological significance is discussed. The Shangdong/7/97-like strains were {HA1/NA} reassortants, as were also the less abundant strains that for {HA1} belonged to the {B/Yamagata/16/88} lineage. A further reassortment, which probably emerged during the outbreak in one of the garrisons, supports our hypothesis that circumstances in these settings may especially favour the emergence of diversity by reassortment.},

	Abstract = {The unexpectedly low efficacy of influenza vaccine during school outbreaks of influenza B virus in the spring of 1987 in Japan was probably attributable to a poor antibody response of vaccinees to the epidemic viruses. An antigenic analysis of the causative B viruses isolated in 1987 and 1988 showed much variation in hemagglutination inhibition patterns. The nucleotide sequences that code for the {HA1} domain of {B/Fukuoka/c-27/81}, {B/Ibaraki/2/85}, {B/Nagasaki/1/87}, and {B/Yamagata/16/88} viruses were determined and compared with those of the previously reported hemagglutinin genes. The nucleotide sequences of the hemagglutinin gene of a new variant, {B/Yamagata/16/88}, had only 93.4\% homology with those of two other viruses from the same epidemic. An analysis of nucleotide and amino acid substitutions of the hemagglutinin genes of influenza B viruses revealed that new and some old variants could cocirculate in the same epidemic. A phylogenetic tree constructed by the neighbor-joining method allowed estimation of an evolutionary rate of 2.3 x 10(-3) synonymous (silent) substitutions per nucleotide site per year in the hemagglutinin gene.},

	Abstract = {{SummaryObjective}
To compare the persistence, susceptibility and resistance of influenza A and influenza B viruses in oseltamivir therapy in outpatients of various ages.
Methods
Virus isolation was done before and 4--6 days after the initiation of oseltamivir therapy for 148 patients with influenza {A/H3N2} and for 66 with influenza B in the 2003--2004 and 2004--2005 influenza seasons. Neuraminidase inhibition assay and neuraminidase or hemagglutinin sequence analysis were done using influenza viruses isolated from these patients.
Results
The virus isolation rate after oseltamivir therapy was significantly higher for influenza B (33.3\%) than for influenza {A/H3N2} (12.8\%, p\&\#xa0;\&lt;\&\#xa0;0.001). The mean {IC50} values before and after oseltamivir therapy were significantly higher in patients with influenza B (10.82 and {11.32\&\#xa0;nM}, respectively) than in patients with influenza {A/H3N2} (0.94 and {0.81\&\#xa0;nM}, respectively, both p\&\#xa0;\&lt;\&\#xa0;0.001). No significant differences in {IC50} among each age group, or no significant increase in {IC50} from before to after oseltamivir therapy was observed. Neuraminidase or hemagglutinin sequence analysis revealed no known genotype with resistance to oseltamivir.
Conclusion
Virus persistence after oseltamivir therapy was longer and {IC50} values were higher in influenza B than influenza A.},

The evolutionary tree constructed from nucleotide sequences suggested the following: (i) the {PB1} gene of the 1957 human pandemic strain, {A/Singapore/1/57} ({H2N2)}, was probably introduced from avian species and was maintained in humans until 1968; (ii) in the 1968 pandemic strain, {A/NT/60/68} ({H3N2)}, the {PB1} gene was not derived from the previously circulating virus in humans but probably from another avian virus; and (iii) a current human {H3N2} virus inherited the {PB1} gene from an {A/NT/60/68-like} virus. Nucleotide sequence analysis also showed that the avian {PB1} gene was introduced into pigs. Hence, transmission of the {PB1} gene from avian to mammalian species is a relatively frequent event. Comparative analysis of deduced amino acid sequences disclosed highly conserved regions in {PB1} proteins, which may be key structures required for {PB1} activities.},

	Abstract = {Summary
Hybrids between species are usually unviable or sterile. One possible mechanism causing reproductive isolation is incompatibility between genes from different species. These ``speciation'' genes are interacting components that cannot function properly when mixed with alleles from other species. To test whether such genes exist in two closely related yeast species, we constructed hybrid lines in which one or two chromosomes were derived from Saccharomyces bayanus, and the rest were from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that the hybrid line with Chromosome 13 substitution was completely sterile and identified Aep2, a mitochondrial protein encoded on Chromosome 13, to cause the sporulation defect as S. bayanus {AEP2} is incompatible with S. cerevisiae mitochondria. This is caused by the inability of S. bayanus Aep2 protein to regulate the translation of the S. cerevisiae {OLI1} {mRNA.} We speculate that {AEP2} and {OLI1} have evolved during the adaptation of S. bayanus to nonfermentable carbon sources, thereby driving speciation.},

Of the type B viruses, 348 isolates collected in different parts of Taiwan were further analyzed. Viruses belonging to both influenza B lineages, {B/Yamagata/16/88} ({B/Yam)} and {B/Victoris/2/87} ({B/Vic)} were detected, although an increasing number of {B/Vic} lineage isolates was obtained as the season progressed. Recent {B/Vic-lineage} isolates were found to have additional amino acid substitutions compared to isolates from previous seasons, indicating that viruses of this lineage continue to evolve significantly and may have the capacity to become the dominant influenza B viruses worldwide. Results presented in this report demonstrate that antigenically and genetically distinct viruses within both {B/Vic} and {B/Yam} lineages co-circulate and that reassortment among these two lineages occurs frequently contributing to the genetic diversity of the circulating strains.},

	Abstract = {Phylogenetic profiles of the genes coding for the hemagglutinin ({HA)} protein, nucleoprotein ({NP)}, matrix (M) protein, and nonstructural ({NS)} proteins of influenza B viruses isolated from 1940 to 1998 were analyzed in a parallel manner in order to understand the evolutionary mechanisms of these viruses. Unlike human influenza A ({H3N2)} viruses, the evolutionary pathways of all four genes of recent influenza B viruses revealed similar patterns of genetic divergence into two major lineages. Although evolutionary rates of the {HA}, {NP}, M, and {NS} genes of influenza B viruses were estimated to be generally lower than those of human influenza A viruses, genes of influenza B viruses demonstrated complex phylogenetic patterns, indicating alternative mechanisms for generation of virus variability. Topologies of the evolutionary trees of each gene were determined to be quite distinct from one another, showing that these genes were evolving in an independent manner. Furthermore, variable topologies were apparently the result of frequent genetic exchange among cocirculating epidemic viruses. Evolutionary analysis done in the present study provided further evidence for cocirculation of multiple lineages as well as sequestering and reemergence of phylogenetic lineages of the internal genes. In addition, comparison of deduced amino acid sequences revealed a novel amino acid deletion in the {HA1} domain of the {HA} protein of recent isolates from 1998 belonging to the {B/Yamagata/16/88-like} lineage. It thus became apparent that, despite lower evolutionary rates, influenza B viruses were able to generate genetic diversity among circulating viruses through a combination of evolutionary mechanisms involving cocirculating lineages and genetic reassortment by which new variants with distinct gene constellations emerged.},

	Abstract = {Author Summary
Emerging infectious diseases such as {SARS}, {HIV} and swine-origin influenza have all been recently acquired by humans from other species. Understanding the reasons why parasites jump between different host species is essential to allow us to predict future threats and understand the causes of disease emergence. Here we ask how host-relatedness might determine when host-shifts can occur in the most important group of emerging {diseases---RNA} viruses. We show that the relationship between host species is the primary factor in determining a virus's ability to persist and replicate in a novel host following exposure. This can be broken down into two components. Firstly, species closely related to the virus's natural host are more susceptible than distantly related species. Secondly, independent of the distance effect, groups of closely related host species have similar levels of susceptibility. This has important implications for our understanding of disease-emergence, and until now the only large-scale studies of viruses have been correlative rather than experimental. We also found groups of related species that are susceptible to these viruses but are distantly related to the natural hosts, which may explain why viruses sometimes jump between distantly related species.},

	Abstract = {The segmented {RNA} genome of avian Influenza viruses ({AIV}) allows genetic reassortment between co-infecting viruses, providing an evolutionary pathway to generate genetic innovation. The genetic diversity (16 haemagglutinin and 9 neuraminidase subtypes) of {AIV} indicates an extensive reservoir of influenza viruses exists in bird populations, but how frequently subtypes reassort with each other is still unknown. Here we quantify the reassortment patterns among subtypes in the Eurasian avian viral pool by reconstructing the ancestral states of the subtypes as discrete states on time-scaled phylogenies with respect to the internal protein coding segments. We further analyzed how host species, the inferred evolutionary rates and the {dN}/{dS} ratio varied among segments and between discrete subtypes, and whether these factors may be associated with inter-subtype reassortment rate.

	Abstract = {Author {SummaryReassortment} is the process by which influenza viruses, which carry {RNA} genomes comprising eight segments, exchange genetic material. Reassortment of the genome segments of two differing influenza strains has the potential to vastly increase the diversity of circulating influenza viruses. Despite its importance to influenza virus evolution, the frequency with which reassortment occurs in a cell or an animal infected with two or more variant viruses is unclear. Toward determining how readily reassortment can occur, we assessed the incidence of reassortment during experimental infection in cultured cells and in guinea pigs. We found that reassortment can occur with high efficiency in both systems, but that that efficiency is dependent on i) the dose of each virus added to the cells or taken up by the host and ii) the relative timing with which each virus infects. These results suggest that influenza A virus reassortment may be more prevalent in nature than one might expect based on the results of surveillance studies.},

	Abstract = {To characterize the genetic diversity of influenza B viruses isolated during one influenza season, the antigenic and genetic relationships among 20 strains of influenza B virus isolated in February and March 2001 at one pediatric clinic in Yamagata City, Japan, were investigated. The {HA} gene and seven other gene segments were phylogenetically divided into three distinct sublineages (Harbin/7/94-, Tokyo/6/98-, and {Shiga/T30/98-related} lineage) of the Yamagata/16/88-like lineage. The {NS} genes of the viruses belonging to the Harbin/7/94-related lineage have additional three nucleotides at positions 439--447, and were phylogenetically distinguishable from those of the currently circulating Yamagata/16/88- and Victoria/2/87-like lineages, but were closely related to that of the Yamagata/16/88-like lineage isolated before 1994. Moreover, four strains of influenza B virus isolated in the same community between 2002 and 2003 were further examined. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that a virus of Victoria/2/87-like lineage isolated in 2003 had acquired the {NA}, {NS}, M, and {PA} gene segments from a {Shiga/T30/98-like} virus, and two strains of Harbin/7/94-related lineage had acquired the various gene segments from {Shiga/T30/98-like} virus through a reassortment event. These results indicate that genetically distinct multiple viruses can combine to cause an influenza B epidemic in a community and that the frequent reassortment among these viruses plays a role in generating the genetic diversity of influenza B viruses.

	Abstract = {The evolution of influenza B viruses is poorly understood. Reassortment of influenza B viruses in nature as a means of genetic variation has not been considered to be a major contributor to their evolution. However, the current practice of assigning evolutionary relationships by antigenic analysis of the hemagglutinin of influenza B viruses would fail to detect reassortants. In this study, influenza B viruses isolated within the past 10 years from sites in the United States and China were studied by nucleotide sequencing of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes and construction of phylogenetic trees to assess evolutionary relationships. A group of viruses represented by {B/Houston/1/92} possess a hemagglutinin derived from a {B/Yamagata/16/88-like} strain and a neuraminidase derived from a {B/Victoria/2/87-like} strain. A second reassortment event between the hemagglutinin of a {B/Yamagata/16/88-like} virus closely related to the {B/Beijing/184/93} strain and the neuraminidase of a {B/Victoria/2/87-like} strain is represented by a single virus, {B/Memphis/3/93.} The neuraminidase of the reassortant viruses is most closely related to that of {B/Victoria/2/87-like} viruses currently circulating in Nanchang, China. A pattern of insertions and deletions in the hemagglutinin and the neuraminidase of different strains of influenza B viruses is observed. Reassortment plays a role in the evolution of influenza B viruses and may necessitate a change in the methods used to assess and identify new influenza viruses.},

@article{mccullers_2004,
	Abstract = {The segmented genome of influenza B virus allows exchange of gene segments between cocirculating strains. Through this process of reassortment, diversity is generated by the mixing of genes between viruses that differ in one or more gene segments. Phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses of all 11 genes of 31 influenza B viruses isolated from 1979 to 2003 were used to study the evolution of whole genomes. All 11 genes diverged into two new lineages prior to 1987. All genes except the {NS1} gene were undergoing linear evolution, although the rate of evolution and the degree to which nucleotide changes translated into amino acid changes varied between lineages and by gene. Frequent reassortment generated 14 different genotypes distinct from the gene constellation of viruses circulating prior to 1979. Multiple genotypes cocirculated in some locations, and a sequence of reassortment events over time could not be established. The surprising diversity of the viruses, unrestricted mixing of lineages, and lack of evidence for coevolution of gene segments do not support the hypothesis that the reassortment process is driven by selection for functional differences.},

@article{minin_2008,
	Abstract = {Kingman's coalescent process opens the door for estimation of population genetics model parameters from molecular sequences. One paramount parameter of interest is the effective population size. Temporal variation of this quantity characterizes the demographic history of a population. Because researchers are rarely able to choose a priori a deterministic model describing effective population size dynamics for data at hand, nonparametric curve-fitting methods based on multiple change-point ({MCP)} models have been developed. We propose an alternative to change-point modeling that exploits Gaussian Markov random fields to achieve temporal smoothing of the effective population size in a Bayesian framework. The main advantage of our approach is that, in contrast to {MCP} models, the explicit temporal smoothing does not require strong prior decisions. To approximate the posterior distribution of the population dynamics, we use efficient, fast mixing Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms designed for highly structured Gaussian models. In a simulation study, we demonstrate that the proposed temporal smoothing method, named Bayesian skyride, successfully recovers ``true'' population size trajectories in all simulation scenarios and competes well with the {MCP} approaches without evoking strong prior assumptions. We apply our Bayesian skyride method to 2 real data sets. We analyze sequences of hepatitis C virus contemporaneously sampled in Egypt, reproducing all key known aspects of the viral population dynamics. Next, we estimate the demographic histories of human influenza A hemagglutinin sequences, serially sampled throughout 3 flu seasons.},

	Abstract = {New antigenic variants of {B/Yamagata/16/88-like} lineage which appeared in the season of 1997 as a minor strain tended to predominate in the following season. Also, we could observe for the first time, three peaks of activity caused by {H3N2} virus and two variants of B influenza virus. Antigenic and phylogenetic analyses revealed that {B/Victoria/2/87-like} variants appeared again in Japan in 1997 after a nine-year absence. Influenza B viruses evolved into three major lineages, including the earliest strain (I), {B/Yamagata/16/88-like} variants ({II)}, which comprised of three sublineages ({II-(i)}, {II-(ii)}, {II-(iii))}, and {B/Victoria/2/87-like} variants ({III).} Evolution of influenza B virus hemagglutinin was apparently distinguishable from that of influenza A virus, showing a systematic mechanism of nucleotide deletion and insertion. This phenomenon was observed to be closely related to evolutionary pathways of I, {II-(i)}, {II-(ii)}, {II-(iii)} and {III} lineages. It was noteworthy to reveal that the nucleotide deletion and insertion mechanism of influenza B virus completed one cycle over a fifty-year period, and that a three nucleotide deletion was again observed in 1997 strains belonging to lineage {II-(} iii). It was evident that amino acid substitutions accompanying nucleotide insertions were highly conserved.},

	Abstract = {Influenza B virus is a human pathogen whose origin and possible reservoir in nature are not known. An influenza B virus was isolated from a naturally infected harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) and was found to be infectious to seal kidney cells in vitro. Sequence analyses and serology indicated that influenza virus {B/Seal/Netherlands/1/99} is closely related to strains that circulated in humans 4 to 5 years earlier. Retrospective analyses of sera collected from 971 seals showed a prevalence of antibodies to influenza B virus in 2\% of the animals after 1995 and in none before 1995. This animal reservoir, harboring influenza B viruses that have circulated in the past, may pose a direct threat to humans.},

	Abstract = {The annual trivalent influenza vaccine ({TIV)} includes viruses representing three influenza strains -- one {A/H1N1}, one {A/H3N2}, and one B, although two antigenically distinct lineages of influenza B (Victoria and Yamagata) co-circulate annually in the United States. Predicting which lineage of influenza B will predominate during a season is challenging, and cross-protection by immunization against the other lineage is expected to be low. One proposed alternative is to produce a quadrivalent influenza vaccine ({QIV)} including an influenza B virus from each of the two circulating lineages. We estimated the additional public health benefit of {QIV} compared with {TIV} by calculating the expected impact on influenza-related health outcomes (illness, hospitalization, and death) over ten influenza seasons (1999/2000--2008/2009). We included data on the annual incidence of influenza-associated outcomes, virologic circulation, vaccine coverage, and vaccine effectiveness. We also considered annual vaccine production capacity, since available resources would have produced four vaccine viruses instead of three, potentially resulting in fewer doses of {QIV.} Use of {QIV} could have reduced annual cases (range: 2200--970,000), hospitalizations (range: 14--8200), and deaths (range: 1--485) in the {US.} During earlier seasons, adjusting production capacity for a fourth virus in {QIV} could have resulted in reduced overall influenza vaccine availability and net increases in influenza-associated outcomes. However, in recent seasons, the expected supply of {QIV} is likely to exceed the doses of vaccine actually administered. The potential net impact of {QIV} on influenza-associated outcomes is expected to vary between seasons, depending on annual variability in the incidence of influenza caused by the two influenza B lineages, vaccine coverage, and effectiveness. The additional protection provided by including a second lineage of influenza B could result in a modest reduction in influenza-associated outcomes.},

@article{rota_1990,
	Abstract = {During 1988--1989 two highly distinct antigenic variants of influenza type B were recognized in hemagglutination-inhibition tests with postinfection ferret serum. These viruses were antigenically related to either {BNictoria/2/87}, the most recent reference strain, or {BNamagata/16/88}, a variant that was isolated in Japan in May 1988. All influenza B viruses isolated in the United States during an epidemic in the winter of 1988--1989 were antigenically related to B/ Victoria/2/87. However, in several countries in Asia, both {BNictoria/2/87-like} viruses and {BNamagata/16/88-like} viruses were isolated. Sequence analysis of the hemagglutinin ({HA)} genes of several influenza B isolates from 1987 to 1988 indicated that the {HA1} domains of the {BNamagata/16/88-like} viruses and {B/VI/87-like} viruses isolated in 1988 differed by 27 amino acids. Evolutionary relationships based on this sequence data indicated that the {BNamagata/16/} 88-like viruses were more closely related to epidemic viruses from 1983 ({B/USSR/100/83-like} viruses) than to more recent reference strains such as {BNictoria/2/87.} All other Asian strains, as well as selected isolates from the United States in 1988, were confirmed by sequence analysis as being genetically related to {BNictoria/2/87.} These data provide clear evidence that two parallel evolutionary pathways of influenza type B have existed since at least 1983 and that viruses from each of the separate lineages were isolated from cases of influenza B in 1988. This finding is similar to earlier observations for type A H 1 N1 and {H3N2} influenza viruses.},

Another source of information is the temporal variance for a given clade implied by a particular constraint when combined with other, well-supported calibrations. For example, the frog Beelzebufo ampinga from the Cretaceous of Madagascar has been hypothesized to be a crown-group member of the New World subfamily Ceratophryinae, which would support a Late Cretaceous connection with South America. However, phylogenetic analyses and molecular divergence time estimates based on other fossils do not support this placement. We derive a metric, Δt, to quantify temporal divergence among chronograms and find that errors resulting from mis-specified calibrations are localized when additional nodes throughout the tree are properly calibrated. The use of temporal information from molecular data can further assist in testing phylogenetic hypotheses regarding the placement of extinct taxa.},

The principle of this method is to find pairs of operational taxonomic units ({OTUs} [= neighbors]) that minimize the total branch length at each stage of clustering of {OTUs} starting with a starlike tree. The branch lengths as well as the topology of a parsimonious tree can quickly be obtained by using this method. Using computer simulation, we studied the efficiency of this method in obtaining the correct unrooted tree in comparison with that of five other tree-making methods: the unweighted pair group method of analysis, Farris's method, Sattath and Tversky's method, Li's method, and Tateno et al.'s modified Farris method. The new, neighbor-joining method and Sattath and Tversky's method are shown to be generally better than the other methods.},

	Abstract = {Two antigenically and genetically distinct lineages of influenza B viruses, represented by the reference strains {B/Victoria/2/1987} and {B/Yamagata/16/1988}, have cocirculated in humans since at least 1983. Between 1992 and 2000, Victoria lineage viruses were detected only in eastern Asia. From March to September of 2001 and during the 2001--2002 influenza season, Victoria lineage viruses were detected for the first time in a decade in several countries including Canada, {USA}, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Philippines, India, and Oman. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin ({HA)} gene of these viruses revealed that the viruses fell into two distinct clades: one group, represented by the reference strain {B/Hong} Kong/330/2001, contained viruses sharing three signature amino acids, Arg116, Asn121, and Glu164, while the other group of viruses, represented by {B/Oman/16296/2001}, shared Thr121 compared to the previous reference strain, {B/Shandong/7/97.} A number of the viruses in the latter group have been found to be reassortants having a Victoria lineage {HA} and a Yamagata lineage {NA.} In the current 2001--2002 season, Victoria-like viruses have now been associated with outbreaks in Asia, Europe, and North America. The reemergence of these Victoria lineage viruses worldwide, the fact that the majority of the {B/Victoria-like} isolates have poor cross-reactivity to {B/Sichuan/379/99-like} viruses in current vaccines, and the lack of exposure of young children in many areas of the world to these viruses has resulted in a World Health Organization Northern Hemisphere recommendation for the inclusion of a {B/Victoria-like} strain in vaccines for the 2002--2003 influenza season.},

	Abstract = {Influenza virus {RNA-dependent} {RNA} polymerase is a multi-functional heterotrimer, which uses a `cap-snatching' mechanism to produce viral {mRNA.} Host cell {mRNA} is cleaved to yield a cap-bearing oligonucleotide, which can be extended using viral genomic {RNA} as a template. The cap-binding and endonuclease activities are only activated once viral genomic {RNA} is bound. This requires signalling from the {RNA-binding} {PB1} subunit to the cap-binding {PB2} subunit, and the interface between these two subunits is essential for the polymerase activity. We have defined this interaction surface by protein crystallography and tested the effects of mutating contact residues on the function of the holo-enzyme. This novel interface is surprisingly small, yet, it has a crucial function in regulating the 250 {kDa} polymerase complex and is completely conserved among avian and human influenza viruses.},

@article{svinti_2013,
	Abstract = {Every year the human population encounters epidemic outbreaks of influenza, and history reveals recurring pandemics that have had devastating consequences. The current work focuses on the development of a robust algorithm for detecting influenza strains that have a composite genomic architecture. These influenza subtypes can be generated through a reassortment process, whereby a virus can inherit gene segments from two different types of influenza particles during replication. Reassortant strains are often not immediately recognised by the adaptive immune system of the hosts and hence may be the source of pandemic outbreaks. Owing to their importance in public health and their infectious ability, it is essential to identify reassortant influenza strains in order to understand the evolution of this virus and describe reassortment pathways that may be biased towards particular viral segments. Phylogenetic methods have been used traditionally to identify reassortant viruses. In many studies up to now, the assumption has been that if two phylogenetic trees differ, it is because reassortment has caused them to be different. While phylogenetic incongruence may be caused by real differences in evolutionary history, it can also be the result of phylogenetic error. Therefore, we wish to develop a method for distinguishing between topological inconsistency that is due to confounding effects and topological inconsistency that is due to reassortment.

@article{ward_2013,
	Abstract = {West Central Africa has been implicated as the epicenter of the {HIV}-1 epidemic, and almost all group M subtypes can be found there. Previous analysis of early {HIV}-1 group M sequences from Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly Zaire, revealed that isolates from a number of individuals fall in different positions in phylogenetic trees constructed from sequences from opposite ends of the genome as a result of recombination between viruses of different subtypes. Here, we use discrete ancestral trait mapping to develop a procedure for quantifying {HIV}-1 group M intersubtype recombination across phylogenies, using individuals' gag (p17) and env (gp41) subtypes. The method was applied to previously described {HIV}-1 group M sequences from samples obtained in Kinshasa early in the global radiation of {HIV}. Nine different p17 and gp41 intersubtype recombinant combinations were present in the data set. The mean number of excess ancestral subtype transitions ({NEST}) required to map individuals' p17 subtypes onto the gp14 phylogeny samples, compared to the number required to map them onto the p17 phylogenies, and vice versa, indicated that excess subtype transitions occurred at a rate of approximately 7 × 10−3 to 8 × 10−3 per lineage per year as a result of intersubtype recombination. Our results imply that intersubtype recombination may have occurred in approximately 20\% of lineages evolving over a period of 30 years and confirm intersubtype recombination as a substantial force in generating {HIV}-1 group M diversity.},

Their sizes give the subtree-prune-and-regraft ({SPR)} distance and the hybridization number of the trees, respectively. We introduce new branching rules that reduce the running time of the algorithms from O(3 k n) and O(3 k n logn) to O(2.42 k n) and O(2.42 k n logn), respectively. In practice, the speed up may be much more than predicted by the worst-case analysis. We confirm this intuition experimentally by computing {MAFs} for simulated trees and trees inferred from protein sequence data. We show that our algorithm is orders of magnitude faster and can handle much larger trees and {SPR} distances than the best previous methods, {treeSAT} and sprdist.},

@article{worobey_2014,
	Abstract = {Zoonotic infectious diseases such as influenza continue to pose a grave threat to human health. However, the factors that mediate the emergence of {RNA} viruses such as influenza A virus ({IAV)} are still incompletely understood. Phylogenetic inference is crucial to reconstructing the origins and tracing the flow of {IAV} within and between hosts. Here we show that explicitly allowing {IAV} host lineages to have independent rates of molecular evolution is necessary for reliable phylogenetic inference of {IAV} and that methods that do not do so, including /`relaxed/' molecular clock models, can be positively misleading. A phylogenomic analysis using a host-specific local clock model recovers extremely consistent evolutionary histories across all genomic segments and demonstrates that the equine {H7N7} lineage is a sister clade to strains from birds---as well as those from humans, swine and the equine {H3N8} lineage---sharing an ancestor with them in the mid to late 1800s. Moreover, major western and eastern hemisphere avian influenza lineages inferred for each gene coalesce in the late 1800s. On the basis of these phylogenies and the synchrony of these key nodes, we infer that the internal genes of avian influenza virus ({AIV)} underwent a global selective sweep beginning in the late 1800s, a process that continued throughout the twentieth century and up to the present. The resulting western hemispheric {AIV} lineage subsequently contributed most of the genomic segments to the 1918 pandemic virus and, independently, the 1963 equine {H3N8} panzootic lineage. This approach provides a clear resolution of evolutionary patterns and processes in {IAV}, including the flow of viral genes and genomes within and between host lineages.},

Middle East respiratory syndrome ({MERS}) is a new human disease caused by a novel coronavirus ({CoV}). Clinical data on {MERS}-{CoV} infections are scarce. We report epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of 47 cases of {MERS}-{CoV} infections, identify knowledge gaps, and define research priorities.
Methods
We abstracted and analysed epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from confirmed cases of sporadic, household, community, and health-care-associated {MERS}-{CoV} infections reported from Saudi Arabia between Sept 1, 2012, and June 15, 2013. Cases were confirmed as having {MERS}-{CoV} by real-time {RT}-{PCR}.
Findings
47 individuals (46 adults, one child) with laboratory-confirmed {MERS}-{CoV} disease were identified; 36 (77\%) were male (male:female ratio 3·3:1). 28 patients died, a 60\% case-fatality rate. The case-fatality rate rose with increasing age. Only two of the 47 cases were previously healthy; most patients (45 [96\%]) had underlying comorbid medical disorders, including diabetes (32 [68\%]), hypertension (16 [34\%]), chronic cardiac disease (13 [28\%]), and chronic renal disease (23 [49\%]). Common symptoms at presentation were fever (46 [98\%]), fever with chills or rigors (41 [87\%]), cough (39 [83\%]), shortness of breath (34 [72\%]), and myalgia (15 [32\%]). Gastrointestinal symptoms were also frequent, including diarrhoea (12 [26\%]), vomiting (ten [21\%]), and abdominal pain (eight [17\%]). All patients had abnormal findings on chest radiography, ranging from subtle to extensive unilateral and bilateral abnormalities. Laboratory analyses showed raised concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase (23 [49\%]) and aspartate aminotransferase (seven [15\%]) and thrombocytopenia (17 [36\%]) and lymphopenia (16 [34\%]).
Interpretation
Disease caused by {MERS}-{CoV} presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations and is associated with substantial mortality in admitted patients who have medical comorbidities. Major gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology, community prevalence, and clinical spectrum of infection and disease need urgent definition.

	Abstract = {{SummaryBackground}
The novel Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}) had, as of Aug 8, 2013, caused 111 virologically confirmed or probable human cases of infection worldwide. We analysed epidemiological and genetic data to assess the extent of human infection, the performance of case detection, and the transmission potential of {MERS}-{CoV} with and without control measures.
Methods
We assembled a comprehensive database of all confirmed and probable cases from public sources and estimated the incubation period and generation time from case cluster data. Using data of numbers of visitors to the Middle East and their duration of stay, we estimated the number of symptomatic cases in the Middle East. We did independent analyses, looking at the growth in incident clusters, the growth in viral population, the reproduction number of cluster index cases, and cluster sizes to characterise the dynamical properties of the epidemic and the transmission scenario.
Findings
The estimated number of symptomatic cases up to Aug 8, 2013, is 940 (95\% {CI} 290--2200), indicating that at least 62\% of human symptomatic cases have not been detected. We find that the case-fatality ratio of primary cases detected via routine surveillance (74\%; 95\% {CI} 49--91) is biased upwards because of detection bias; the case-fatality ratio of secondary cases was 20\% (7--42). Detection of milder cases (or clinical management) seemed to have improved in recent months. Analysis of human clusters indicated that chains of transmission were not self-sustaining when infection control was implemented, but that R in the absence of controls was in the range 0·8--1·3. Three independent data sources provide evidence that R cannot be much above 1, with an upper bound of 1·2--1·5.
Interpretation
By showing that a slowly growing epidemic is underway either in human beings or in an animal reservoir, quantification of uncertainty in transmissibility estimates, and provision of the first estimates of the scale of the epidemic and extent of case detection biases, we provide valuable information for more informed risk assessment.

	Abstract = {In its largest outbreak, Ebola virus disease is spreading through Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria. We sequenced 99 Ebola virus genomes from 78 patients in Sierra Leone to {\textasciitilde}2000× coverage. We observed a rapid accumulation of interhost and intrahost genetic variation, allowing us to characterize patterns of viral transmission over the initial weeks of the epidemic. This West African variant likely diverged from central African lineages around 2004, crossed from Guinea to Sierra Leone in May 2014, and has exhibited sustained human-to-human transmission subsequently, with no evidence of additional zoonotic sources. Because many of the mutations alter protein sequences and other biologically meaningful targets, they should be monitored for impact on diagnostics, vaccines, and therapies critical to outbreak response.
Evolution of Ebola virus over time
The high rate of mortality in the current Ebola epidemic has made it difficult for researchers to collect samples of the virus and study its evolution. Gire et al. describe Ebola epidemiology on the basis of 99 whole-genome sequences, including samples from 78 affected individuals. The authors analyzed changes in the viral sequence and conclude that the current outbreak probably resulted from the spread of the virus from central Africa in the past decade. The outbreak started from a single transmission event from an unknown animal reservoir into the human population. Two viral lineages from Guinea then spread from person to person into Sierra Leone.

	Abstract = {Here, we present an analysis of the H1N1pdm genetic data sampled over the initial stages in the epidemic. To infer phylodynamic spread in time and space we employ a recently developed Bayesian statistical inference framework (Lemey et al., in press). We model spatial diffusion as a continuous-time Markov chain process along time-measured genealogies. In this analysis, we consider 40 locations for which sequence data were available on 06-Aug-2009. The sampling time interval of the 242 sequences spans from 30-Mar-2009 to 12-Jul-2009. The Bayesian inference typically results in a posterior distribution of phylogenetic trees, each having an estimate of the epidemic locations at the ancestral nodes in the tree. We summarize these trees using the most representative clustering pattern and annotate these clusters with the most probable location states. We can visualize this information as tree that grows over time, seeding locations each time an ancestral node is inferred to exist at a different location. A Bayes factor test provides statistical support for epidemiological linkage throughout the evolutionary history. We demonstrate how our full probabilistic approach efficiently tracks an epidemic based on viral genetic data as it unfolds across the globe.},

Here we have updated initial estimates of the rate of molecular evolution and estimates of the time of origin of this virus in the human population using the large number of viral sequences made available as part of the public health response to this global pandemic. Currently sampled H1N1pdm sequences share a most recent common ancestor in the first 7 weeks of 2009 with the implication that the virus was transmitting cryptically for up to 3 months prior to recognition.

@article{smith_2009,
	Abstract = {In March and early April 2009, a new swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-{OIV}) emerged in Mexico and the United States. During the first few weeks of surveillance, the virus spread worldwide to 30 countries (as of May 11) by human-to-human transmission, causing the World Health Organization to raise its pandemic alert to level 5 of 6. This virus has the potential to develop into the first influenza pandemic of the twenty-first century. Here we use evolutionary analysis to estimate the timescale of the origins and the early development of the S-{OIV} epidemic. We show that it was derived from several viruses circulating in swine, and that the initial transmission to humans occurred several months before recognition of the outbreak. A phylogenetic estimate of the gaps in genetic surveillance indicates a long period of unsampled ancestry before the S-{OIV} outbreak, suggesting that the reassortment of swine lineages may have occurred years before emergence in humans, and that the multiple genetic ancestry of S-{OIV} is not indicative of an artificial origin. Furthermore, the unsampled history of the epidemic means that the nature and location of the genetically closest swine viruses reveal little about the immediate origin of the epidemic, despite the fact that we included a panel of closely related and previously unpublished swine influenza isolates. Our results highlight the need for systematic surveillance of influenza in swine, and provide evidence that the mixing of new genetic elements in swine can result in the emergence of viruses with pandemic potential in humans.},

	Abstract = {The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}) was first documented in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ({KSA}) in 2012 and, to date, has been identified in 180 cases with 43\% mortality. In this study, we have determined the {MERS}-{CoV} evolutionary rate, documented genetic variants of the virus and their distribution throughout the Arabian peninsula, and identified the genome positions under positive selection, important features for monitoring adaptation of {MERS}-{CoV} to human transmission and for identifying the source of infections. Respiratory samples from confirmed {KSA} {MERS} cases from May to September 2013 were subjected to whole-genome deep sequencing, and 32 complete or partial sequences (20 were ≥99\% complete, 7 were 50 to 94\% complete, and 5 were 27 to 50\% complete) were obtained, bringing the total available {MERS}-{CoV} genomic sequences to 65. An evolutionary rate of 1.12 × 10−3 substitutions per site per year (95\% credible interval [95\% {CI}], 8.76 × 10−4; 1.37 × 10−3) was estimated, bringing the time to most recent common ancestor to March 2012 (95\% {CI}, December 2011; June 2012). Only one {MERS}-{CoV} codon, spike 1020, located in a domain required for cell entry, is under strong positive selection. Four {KSA} {MERS}-{CoV} phylogenetic clades were found, with 3 clades apparently no longer contributing to current cases. The size of the population infected with {MERS}-{CoV} showed a gradual increase to June 2013, followed by a decline, possibly due to increased surveillance and infection control measures combined with a basic reproduction number (R0) for the virus that is less than 1.
{IMPORTANCE} {MERS}-{CoV} adaptation toward higher rates of sustained human-to-human transmission appears not to have occurred yet. While {MERS}-{CoV} transmission currently appears weak, careful monitoring of changes in {MERS}-{CoV} genomes and of the {MERS} epidemic should be maintained. The observation of phylogenetically related {MERS}-{CoV} in geographically diverse locations must be taken into account in efforts to identify the animal source and transmission of the virus.},

	Abstract = {{SummaryBackground}
The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}) is an emerging virus involved in cases and case clusters of severe acute respiratory infection in the Arabian Peninsula, Tunisia, Morocco, France, Italy, Germany, and the {UK}. We provide a full description of a fatal case of {MERS}-{CoV} infection and associated phylogenetic analyses.
Methods
We report data for a patient who was admitted to the Klinikum Schwabing (Munich, Germany) for severe acute respiratory infection. We did diagnostic {RT}-{PCR} and indirect immunofluorescence. From time of diagnosis, respiratory, faecal, and urine samples were obtained for virus quantification. We constructed a maximum likelihood tree of the five available complete {MERS}-{CoV} genomes.
Findings
A 73-year-old man from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, was transferred to Klinikum Schwabing on March 19, 2013, on day 11 of illness. He had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2008, and had received several lines of treatment. The patient died on day 18, due to septic shock. {MERS}-{CoV} was detected in two samples of bronchoalveolar fluid. Viral loads were highest in samples from the lower respiratory tract (up to 1·2 × 106 copies per {mL}). Maximum virus concentration in urine samples was 2691 {RNA} copies per {mL} on day 13; the virus was not present in the urine after renal failure on day 14. Stool samples obtained on days 12 and 16 contained the virus, with up to 1031 {RNA} copies per g (close to the lowest detection limit of the assay). One of two oronasal swabs obtained on day 16 were positive, but yielded little viral {RNA} (5370 copies per {mL}). No virus was detected in blood. The full virus genome was combined with four other available full genome sequences in a maximum likelihood phylogeny, correlating branch lengths with dates of isolation. The time of the common ancestor was halfway through 2011. Addition of novel genome data from an unlinked case treated 6 months previously in Essen, Germany, showed a clustering of viruses derived from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
Interpretation
We have provided the first complete viral load profile in a case of {MERS}-{CoV} infection. {MERS}-{CoV} might have shedding patterns that are different from those of severe acute respiratory syndrome and so might need alternative diagnostic approaches.

	Abstract = {Canine parvovirus ({CPV}) and feline panleukopenia virus ({FPV}) are over 98\% similar in {DNA} sequence but have specific host range, antigenic, and hemagglutination ({HA}) properties which were located within the capsid protein gene. In vitro mutagenesis and recombination were used to prepare 16 different recombinant genomic clones, and viruses derived from those clones were analyzed for their in vitro host range, antigenic, and {HA} properties. The region of {CPV} from 59 to 91 map units determined the ability to replicate in canine cells. A complex series of interactions was observed among the individual sequence differences between 59 and 73 map units. The canine host range required that {VP}2 amino acids (aa) 93 and 323 both be the {CPV} sequence, and those two {CPV} sequences introduced alone into {FPV} greatly increased viral replication in canine cells. Changing any one of aa 93, 103, or 323 of {CPV} to the {FPV} sequence either greatly decreased replication in canine cells or resulted in an inviable plasmid. The Asn-Lys difference of aa 93 alone was responsible for the {CPV}-specific epitope recognized by monoclonal antibodies. An {FPV}-specific epitope was affected by aa 323. Amino acids 323 and 375 together determined the {pH} dependence of {HA}. Amino acids involved in the various specific properties were all around the threefold spikes of the viral particle.},

	Abstract = {The single gene reassortant virus that derives its {PB}2 gene from the avian influenza A/Mallard/{NY}/78 virus and remaining genes from the human influenza A/Los Angeles/2/87 virus exhibits a host range restriction (hr) phenotype characterized by efficient replication in avian tissue and failure to produce plaques in mammalian Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. The hr phenotype is associated with restriction of viral replication in the respiratory tract of squirrel monkeys and humans. To identify the genetic basis of the hr phenotype, we isolated four phenotypic hr mutant viruses that acquired the ability to replicate efficiently in mammalian tissue. Segregational analysis indicated that the loss of the hr phenotype was due to a mutation in the {PB}2 gene itself. The nucleotide sequences of the {PB}2 gene of each of the four hr mutants revealed that a single amino acid substitution at position 627 (Glu--{\textgreater}Lys) was responsible for the restoration of the ability of the {PB}2 single gene reassortant to replicate in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Interestingly, the amino acid at position 627 in every avian influenza A virus {PB}2 protein analyzed to date is glutamic acid, and in every human influenza A virus {PB}2 protein, it is lysine. Thus, the amino acid at residue 627 of {PB}2 is an important determinant of host range of influenza A viruses.},

However, passage of wild-type virus with a combination of {AZT} and {FTC} appreciably delayed emergence of {FTC}-resistant virus. {DNA} sequence analysis of the reverse transcriptase coding region from {FTC}-resistant virus revealed changes at codon 184 in the highly conserved Tyr, Met, Asp, Asp ({YMDD}) region. When the mutation Met184--{\textgreater}Val was introduced into the infectious clone {HXB}2, this change alone accounted for the resistance ({\textgreater} 1000-fold) seen with both 3TC and {FTC}, and for a 5- to 15-fold reduction in sensitivity to their (+) enantiomers. It had no effect on susceptibility to {AZT} or nevirapine and minimal effect on susceptibility to 2',3'-dideoxyinosine and 2',3'-dideoxycytidine. To determine the influence of this mutation in a background of mutations conferring resistance to {AZT} and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, a series of {HIV}-1 variants were created by site-directed mutagenesis. All mutants with Met184--{\textgreater}Val were cross-resistant to 3TC and {FTC}. The Met184--{\textgreater}Val mutation did not influence nevirapine resistance, but resistance to {AZT} was suppressed. Similar suppression of {AZT} resistance was seen with Tyr181--{\textgreater}Cys. Interestingly, when both Met184--{\textgreater}Val and Tyr181--{\textgreater}Cys substitutions were present, highly resistant virus reverted to complete {AZT} sensitivity. Assessment of the interactive effects of multiple drug-resistance mutations may help to establish a rationale for using these drugs in the future therapy of {HIV} disease.},

	Abstract = {Volunteers experimentally infected with influenza A/Texas/36/91 (H1N1) virus and treated with the neuraminidase ({NA}) inhibitor oseltamivir were monitored for the emergence of drugresistant variants. Two (4\%) of 54 resistant viruses were detected by {NA} inhibition assay among last-day isolates recovered from 54 drug recipients. They bore a substitution His274Tyr in the {NA}. Hemagglutinin ({HA}) variants detected in the placebo group differed from the eggadapted inoculum virus by virtue of amino acid substitutions at residues 137, 225, or both. These variants had a higher affinity for Neu5Ac(α2--6)Gal-containing receptors, which are characteristic of human respiratory epithelium, than for Neu5Ac(α2--3)Gal-containing receptors, which are typical of chicken egg allantoic membrane. Although appearing to be more sensitive to oseltamivir in humans, the variants with increased affinity for Neu5Ac(α2--6)Gal receptors were less sensitive than the Neu5Ac(α2--3)Gal-binding variants in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Thus, {HA} affinity for receptors is an essential feature of influenza virus susceptibility to {NA} inhibitors, both in cell culture and in humans.},

	Abstract = {The authors consider Bayesian analysis for continuous-time Markov chain models based on a conditional reference prior. For such models, inference of the elapsed time between chain observations depends heavily on the rate of decay of the prior as the elapsed time increases. Moreover, improper priors on the elapsed time may lead to improper posterior distributions. In addition, an infinitesimal rate matrix also characterizes this class of models. Experts often have good prior knowledge about the parameters of this matrix. The authors show that the use of a proper prior for the rate matrix parameters together with the conditional reference prior for the elapsed time yields a proper posterior distribution. The authors also demonstrate that, when compared to analyses based on priors previously proposed in the literature, a Bayesian analysis on the elapsed time based on the conditional reference prior possesses better frequentist properties. The type of prior thus represents a better default prior choice for estimation software.},

	Abstract = {Recombination is increasingly seen as an important means of shaping genetic diversity in {RNA} viruses. However, observed recombination frequencies vary widely among those viruses studied to date, with only sporadic occurrences reported in {RNA} viruses with negative-sense genomes. To determine the extent of homologous recombination in negative-sense {RNA} viruses, phylogenetic analyses of 79 gene sequence alignments from 35 negative-sense {RNA} viruses (a total of 2154 sequences) were carried out. Powerful evidence was found for recombination, in the form of incongruent phylogenetic trees between different gene regions, in only five sequences from Hantaan virus, Mumps virus and Newcastle disease virus. This is the first report of recombination in these viruses. More tentative evidence for recombination, where conflicting phylogenetic trees were observed (but were without strong bootstrap support) and/or where putative recombinant regions were very short, was found in three alignments from La Crosse virus and Puumala virus. Finally, patterns of sequence variation compatible with the action of recombination, but not definitive evidence for this process, were observed in a further ten viruses: Canine distemper virus, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, Influenza A virus, Influenza B virus, Influenza C virus, Lassa virus, Pirital virus, Rabies virus, Rift Valley Fever virus and Vesicular stomatitis virus. The possibility of recombination in these viruses should be investigated further. Overall, this study reveals that rates of homologous recombination in negative-sense {RNA} viruses are very much lower than those of mutation, with many viruses seemingly clonal on current data. Consequently, recombination rate is unlikely to be a trait that is set by natural selection to create advantageous or purge deleterious mutations.},

Two situations were studied: (i) where both loci had no effect on fitness and (ii) where they showed heterozygote superiority, but no epistacy.If the populations are initially in linkage equilibrium, then the mean value {ofD} remains zero with inbreeding, but the mean {ofD} (2) increases to a maximum value and decreases until fixation is reached at both loci. The tighter the linkage and the greater the selection, then the later is the maximum in the mean {ofD} (2) reached, and the larger its value. The correlation of gene frequencies,r, in the population of gametes within segregating lines was also studied. It was found that, for a range of selection intensities and initial gene frequencies, the mean value ofr (2) was determined almost entirely {byN} c and time, measured proportional {toN}.The implication of these results on observations of linkage disequilibrium in natural populations is discussed.},

	Abstract = {A new statistical method for estimating divergence dates of species from {DNA} sequence data by a molecular clock approach is developed. This method takes into account effectively the information contained in a set of {DNA} sequence data. The molecular clock of mitochondrial {DNA} ({mtDNA)} was calibrated by setting the date of divergence between primates and ungulates at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (65 million years ago), when the extinction of dinosaurs occurred. A generalized leastsquares method was applied in fitting a model to {mtDNA} sequence data, and the clock gave dates of 92.3$\pm$11.7, 13.3$\pm$1.5, 10.9$\pm$1.2, 3.7$\pm$0.6, and 2.7$\pm$0.6 million years ago (where the second of each pair of numbers is the standard deviation) for the separation of mouse, gibbon, orangutan, gorilla, and chimpanzee, respectively, from the line leading to humans. Although there is some uncertainty in the clock, this dating may pose a problem for the widely believed hypothesis that the bipedal {creatureAustralopithecus} afarensis, which lived some 3.7 million years ago at Laetoli in Tanzania and at Hadar in Ethiopia, was ancestral to man and evolved after the human-ape splitting. Another likelier possibility is that {mtDNA} was transferred through hybridization between a proto-human and a protochimpanzee after the former had developed bipedalism.},

	Abstract = {Author {SummaryWe} present a new likelihood-based method to infer the past demography of a set of populations from large genomic datasets. Our method can be applied to arbitrarily complex models as the likelihood is estimated by coalescent simulations. Under simple scenarios, our method behaves similarly to a widely used diffusion-based method while showing better convergence properties. In addition, our approach can be applied to very complex models including as many as a dozen populations, and still retrieve parameters very accurately in a reasonable time. We apply our approach to estimate the past demography of four human populations for which non-coding whole genome diversity is available, estimating the degree of European admixture of a southwest African American population and that of a Kenyan population with an unsampled East African population. We also show the versatility of our framework by inferring the demographic history of African populations from {SNP} chip data with known ascertainment bias, and find a very old divergence time ({\textgreater}110 Ky) between Yorubas from Western Africa and Sans from Southern Africa.},

	Abstract = {Researchers routinely estimate distances between molecular sequences using continuous-time Markov chain models. We present a new method, robust counting, that protects against the possibly severe bias arising from model misspecification. We achieve this robustness by generalizing the conventional distance estimation to incorporate the empirical distribution of site patterns found in the observed pairwise sequence alignment. Our flexible framework allows for computing distances based only on a subset of possible substitutions. From this, we show how to estimate labeled codon distances, such as expected numbers of synonymous or nonsynonymous substitutions. We present two simulation studies. The first compares the relative bias and variance of conventional and robust labeled nucleotide estimators. In the second simulation, we demonstrate that robust counting furnishes accurate synonymous and nonsynonymous distance estimates based only on easy-to-fit models of nucleotide substitution, bypassing the need for computationally expensive codon models. We conclude with three empirical examples. In the first two examples, we investigate the evolutionary dynamics of the influenza A hemagglutinin gene using labeled codon distances. In the final example, we demonstrate the advantages of using robust synonymous distances to alleviate the effect of convergent evolution on phylogenetic analysis of an {HIV} transmission network.},

	Abstract = {We describe a model-based method for using multilocus sequence data to infer the clonal relationships of bacteria and the chromosomal position of homologous recombination events that disrupt a clonal pattern of inheritance. The key assumption of our model is that recombination events introduce a constant rate of substitutions to a contiguous region of sequence. The method is applicable both to multilocus sequence typing ({MLST}) data from a few loci and to alignments of multiple bacterial genomes. It can be used to decide whether a subset of isolates share common ancestry, to estimate the age of the common ancestor, and hence to address a variety of epidemiological and ecological questions that hinge on the pattern of bacterial spread. It should also be useful in associating particular genetic events with the changes in phenotype that they cause. We show that the model outperforms existing methods of subdividing recombinogenic bacteria using {MLST} data and provide examples from Salmonella and Bacillus. The software used in this article, {ClonalFrame}, is available from http://bacteria.stats.ox.ac.uk/.},

@article{guindon_2003,
	Abstract = {The increase in the number of large data sets and the complexity of current probabilistic sequence evolution models necessitates fast and reliable phylogeny reconstruction methods. We describe a new approach, based on the maximum-likelihood principle, which clearly satisfies these requirements. The core of this method is a simple hill-climbing algorithm that adjusts tree topology and branch lengths simultaneously. This algorithm starts from an initial tree built by a fast distance-based method and modifies this tree to improve its likelihood at each iteration. Due to this simultaneous adjustment of the topology and branch lengths, only a few iterations are sufficient to reach an optimum. We used extensive and realistic computer simulations to show that the topological accuracy of this new method is at least as high as that of the existing maximum-likelihood programs and much higher than the performance of distance-based and parsimony approaches. The reduction of computing time is dramatic in comparison with other maximum-likelihood packages, while the likelihood maximization ability tends to be higher. For example, only 12 min were required on a standard personal computer to analyze a data set consisting of 500 rbc L sequences with 1,428 base pairs from plant plastids, thus reaching a speed of the same order as some popular distance-based and parsimony algorithms. This new method is implemented in the {PHYML} program, which is freely available on our web page: http://www.lirmm.fr/w3ifa/{MAAS}/.},

@article{baele_2012,
	Abstract = {Recent developments in marginal likelihood estimation for model selection in the field of Bayesian phylogenetics and molecular evolution have emphasized the poor performance of the harmonic mean estimator ({HME}). Although these studies have shown the merits of new approaches applied to standard normally distributed examples and small real-world data sets, not much is currently known concerning the performance and computational issues of these methods when fitting complex evolutionary and population genetic models to empirical real-world data sets. Further, these approaches have not yet seen widespread application in the field due to the lack of implementations of these computationally demanding techniques in commonly used phylogenetic packages. We here investigate the performance of some of these new marginal likelihood estimators, specifically, path sampling ({PS}) and stepping-stone ({SS}) sampling for comparing models of demographic change and relaxed molecular clocks, using synthetic data and real-world examples for which unexpected inferences were made using the {HME}. Given the drastically increased computational demands of {PS} and {SS} sampling, we also investigate a posterior simulation-based analogue of Akaike's information criterion ({AIC}) through Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}), a model comparison approach that shares with the {HME} the appealing feature of having a low computational overhead over the original {MCMC} analysis. We confirm that the {HME} systematically overestimates the marginal likelihood and fails to yield reliable model classification and show that the {AICM} performs better and may be a useful initial evaluation of model choice but that it is also, to a lesser degree, unreliable. We show that {PS} and {SS} sampling substantially outperform these estimators and adjust the conclusions made concerning previous analyses for the three real-world data sets that we reanalyzed. The methods used in this article are now available in {BEAST}, a powerful user-friendly software package to perform Bayesian evolutionary analyses.},

@article{yang_1994,
	Abstract = {Two approximate methods are proposed for maximum likelihood phylogenetic estimation, which allow variable rates of substitution across nucleotide sites. Three data sets with quite different characteristics were analyzed to examine empirically the performance of these methods. The first, called the ``discrete gamma model,'' uses several categories of rates to approximate the gamma distribution, with equal probability for each category. The mean of each category is used to represent all the rates falling in the category. The performance of this method is found to be quite good, and four such categories appear to be sufficient to produce both an optimum, or near-optimum fit by the model to the data, and also an acceptable approximation to the continuous distribution. The second method, called ``fixed-rates model,'' classifies sites into several classes according to their rates predicted assuming the star tree. Sites in different classes are then assumed to be evolving at these fixed rates when other tree topologies are evaluated. Analyses of the data sets suggest that this method can produce reasonable results, but it seems to share some properties of a least-squares pairwise comparison; for example, interior branch lengths in nonbest trees are often found to be zero. The computational requirements of the two methods are comparable to that of Felsenstein's (1981, J Mol Evol 17:368--376) model, which assumes a single rate for all the sites.},

	Abstract = {Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}) is a novel betacoronavirus that has been circulating in the Arabian Peninsula since 2012 and causing severe respiratory infections in humans. While bats were suggested to be involved in human {MERS}-{CoV} infections, a direct link between bats and {MERS}-{CoV} is uncertain. On the other hand, serological and virological data suggest dromedary camels as the potential animal reservoirs of {MERS}-{CoV}. Recently, we isolated {MERS}-{CoV} from a camel and its infected owner and provided evidence for the direct transmission of {MERS}-{CoV} from the infected camel to the patient. Here, we extend this work and show that identical {MERS}-{CoV} {RNA} fragments were detected in an air sample collected from the same barn that sheltered the infected camel in our previous study. These data indicate that the virus was circulating in this farm concurrently with its detection in the camel and in the patient, which warrants further investigations for the possible airborne transmission of {MERS}-{CoV}.
{IMPORTANCE} This work clearly highlights the importance of continuous surveillance and infection control measures to control the global public threat of {MERS}-{CoV}. While current {MERS}-{CoV} transmission appears to be limited, we advise minimal contact with camels, especially for immunocompromised individuals, and the use of appropriate health, safety, and infection prevention and control measures when dealing with infected patients. Also, detailed clinical histories of any {MERS}-{CoV} cases with epidemiological and laboratory investigations carried out for any animal exposure must be considered to identify any animal source.},

	Abstract = {Complete Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}) genome sequences were obtained from nasal swabs of dromedary camels sampled in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia through direct analysis of nucleic acid extracts or following virus isolation in cell culture. Consensus dromedary {MERS}-{CoV} genome sequences were the same with either template source and identical to published human {MERS}-{CoV} sequences. However, in contrast to individual human cases, where only clonal genomic sequences are reported, detailed population analyses revealed the presence of more than one genomic variant in individual dromedaries. If humans are truly infected only with clonal virus populations, we must entertain a model for interspecies transmission of {MERS}-{CoV} wherein only specific genotypes are capable of passing bottleneck selection.
{IMPORTANCE} In most cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome ({MERS}), the route for human infection with the causative agent, {MERS} coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}), is unknown. Antibodies to and viral nucleic acids of {MERS}-{CoV} have been found in dromedaries, suggesting the possibility that they may serve as a reservoir or vector for human infection. However, neither whole viral genomic sequence nor infectious virus has been isolated from dromedaries or other animals in Saudi Arabia. Here, we report recovery of {MERS}-{CoV} from nasal swabs of dromedaries, demonstrate that {MERS}-{CoV} whole-genome consensus sequences from dromedaries and humans are indistinguishable, and show that dromedaries can be simultaneously infected with more than one {MERS}-{CoV}. Together with data indicating widespread dromedary infection in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, these findings support the plausibility of a role for dromedaries in human infection.},

While in such a model the identity of alleles is not considered, the {CLE} has been shown to be robust to minor misspecification of the underlying mutational model. However, there are many situations where the putative mutation and demographic history can be quite complex. One good example is rapidly evolving pathogens, like {HIV}-1. First we evaluated the performance of the {CLE} and the likelihood permutation test ({LPT}) under more complex, realistic models, including a general time reversible ({GTR}) substitution model, rate heterogeneity among sites (Γ), positive selection, population growth, population structure, and noncontemporaneous sampling. Second, we relaxed some of the assumptions of the {CLE} allowing for a four-allele, {GTR} + Γ model in an attempt to use the data more efficiently. Through simulations and the analysis of real data, we concluded that the {CLE} is robust to severe misspecifications of the substitution model, but underestimates the recombination rate in the presence of exponential growth, population mixture, selection, or noncontemporaneous sampling. In such cases, the use of more complex models slightly increases performance in some occasions, especially in the case of the {LPT}. Thus, our results provide for a more robust application of the estimation of recombination rates.},

	Abstract = {The emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}) causes lethal respiratory infections mainly on the Arabian Peninsula. The evolutionary origins of {MERS}-{CoV} are unknown. We determined the full genome sequence of a {CoV} directly from fecal material obtained from a South African Neoromicia capensis bat ({NeoCoV}). {NeoCoV} shared essential details of genome architecture with {MERS}-{CoV}. Eighty-five percent of the {NeoCoV} genome was identical to {MERS}-{CoV} at the nucleotide level. Based on taxonomic criteria, {NeoCoV} and {MERS}-{CoV} belonged to one viral species. The presence of a genetically divergent S1 subunit within the {NeoCoV} spike gene indicated that intraspike recombination events may have been involved in the emergence of {MERS}-{CoV}. {NeoCoV} constitutes a sister taxon of {MERS}-{CoV}, placing the {MERS}-{CoV} root between a recently described virus from African camels and all other viruses. This suggests a higher level of viral diversity in camels than in humans. Together with serologic evidence for widespread {MERS}-{CoV} infection in camelids sampled up to 20 years ago in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, the genetic data indicate that camels act as sources of virus for humans rather than vice versa. The majority of camels on the Arabian Peninsula is imported from the Greater Horn of Africa, where several Neoromicia species occur. The acquisition of {MERS}-{CoV} by camels from bats might have taken place in sub-Saharan Africa. Camelids may represent mixing vessels for {MERS}-{CoV} and other mammalian {CoVs}.
{IMPORTANCE} It is unclear how, when, and where the highly pathogenic {MERS}-{CoV} emerged. We characterized the full genome of an African bat virus closely related to {MERS}-{CoV} and show that human, camel, and bat viruses belong to the same viral species. The bat virus roots the phylogenetic tree of {MERS}-{CoV}, providing evidence for an evolution of {MERS}-{CoV} in camels that preceded that in humans. The revised tree suggests that humans are infected by camels rather than vice versa. Although {MERS}-{CoV} cases occur mainly on the Arabian Peninsula, the data from this study together with serologic and molecular investigations of African camels indicate that the initial host switch from bats may have taken place in Africa. The emergence of {MERS}-{CoV} likely involved exchanges of genetic elements between different viral ancestors. These exchanges may have taken place either in bat ancestors or in camels acting as mixing vessels for viruses from different hosts.},

	Abstract = {{SummaryBackground}
Since June, 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}) has, worldwide, caused 104 infections in people including 49 deaths, with 82 cases and 41 deaths reported from Saudi Arabia. In addition to confirming diagnosis, we generated the {MERS}-{CoV} genomic sequences obtained directly from patient samples to provide important information on {MERS}-{CoV} transmission, evolution, and origin.
Methods
Full genome deep sequencing was done on nucleic acid extracted directly from {PCR}-confirmed clinical samples. Viral genomes were obtained from 21 {MERS} cases of which 13 had 100\%, four 85--95\%, and four 30--50\% genome coverage. Phylogenetic analysis of the 21 sequences, combined with nine published {MERS}-{CoV} genomes, was done.
Findings
Three distinct {MERS}-{CoV} genotypes were identified in Riyadh. Phylogeographic analyses suggest the {MERS}-{CoV} zoonotic reservoir is geographically disperse. Selection analysis of the {MERS}-{CoV} genomes reveals the expected accumulation of genetic diversity including changes in the S protein. The genetic diversity in the Al-Hasa cluster suggests that the hospital outbreak might have had more than one virus introduction.
Interpretation
We present the largest number of {MERS}-{CoV} genomes (21) described so far. {MERS}-{CoV} full genome sequences provide greater detail in tracking transmission. Multiple introductions of {MERS}-{CoV} are identified and suggest lower R0 values. Transmission within Saudi Arabia is consistent with either movement of an animal reservoir, animal products, or movement of infected people. Further definition of the exposures responsible for the sporadic introductions of {MERS}-{CoV} into human populations is urgently needed.

	Abstract = {Background. In spring 2014, a sudden rise in the number of notified {MERS}-Coronavirus infections occurred across Saudi Arabia with a focus in Jeddah. Hypotheses to explain the outbreak pattern include increased surveillance, increased zoonotic transmission, nosocomial transmission, changes in viral transmissibility, as well as diagnostic laboratory artifacts.
Methods. Diagnostic results from Jeddah Regional Laboratory were analyzed. Viruses from the Jeddah outbreak and viruses occurring during the same time in Riyadh, Al-Kharj, and Madinah were fully or partially sequenced. A set of four single nucleotide polymorphisms distinctive to the Jeddah outbreak were determined from additional viruses. Viruses from Riyadh and Jeddah were isolated and studied in cell culture.
Results and conclusions. Up to 481 samples were received per day for {RT}-{PCR} testing. A laboratory proficiency assessment suggested positive and negative results to be reliable. Forty-nine percent of 168 positive-testing samples during the Jeddah outbreak stemmed from King Fahd Hospital. All viruses from Jeddah were monophyletic and similar, while viruses from Riyadh were paraphyletic and diverse. A hospital-associated transmission cluster, to which cases in Indiana/{USA} and the Netherlands belonged, was discovered in Riyadh. One Jeddah-type virus was found in Riyadh, with matching travel history to Jeddah. Virus isolates representing outbreaks in Jeddah and Riyadh were not different from {MERS}-{CoV} {EMC}/2012 in replication, escape of interferon response, and serum neutralization. Detection rates and average virus concentrations did not change significantly over the outbreak in Jeddah. These results suggest the outbreaks to have been caused by biologically unchanged viruses in connection with nosocomial transmission.},

	Abstract = {Horizontal gene transfer is an important driver of bacterial evolution, but genetic exchange in the core genome of clonal species, including the major pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, is incompletely understood. Here we reveal widespread homologous recombination in S. aureus at the species level, in contrast to its near-complete absence between closely related strains. We discover a patchwork of hotspots and coldspots at fine scales falling against a backdrop of broad-scale trends in rate variation. Over megabases, homoplasy rates fluctuate 1.9-fold, peaking towards the origin-of-replication. Over kilobases, we find core recombination hotspots of up to 2.5-fold enrichment situated near fault lines in the genome associated with mobile elements. The strongest hotspots include regions flanking conjugative transposon {ICE}6013, the staphylococcal cassette chromosome ({SCC}) and genomic island νSaα. Mobile element-driven core genome transfer represents an opportunity for adaptation and challenges our understanding of the recombination landscape in predominantly clonal pathogens, with important implications for genotype--phenotype mapping.},

	Abstract = {The extent to which recombination disrupts the bifurcating treelike phylogeny and clonal structure imposed by binary fission on bacterial populations remains contentious. Here, we address this question with a study of nucleotide sequence data from 107 isolates of the human pathogen Neisseria meningitidis. Gene fragments from 12 house-keeping loci distributed around the meningococcal chromosome were analyzed, showing that (1) identical alleles are disseminated among genetically diverse isolates, with no evidence for linkage disequilibrium; (2) different loci give distinct and incongruent phylogenetic trees; and (3) allele sequences are incompatible with a bifurcating treelike phylogeny at all loci. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that meningococcal populations comprise organisms assembled from a common gene pool, with alleles and allele fragments spreading independently, together with the occasional importation of genetic material from other species. Further, they support the view that recombination is an important genetic mechanism in the generation new meningococcal clones and alleles. Consequently, for anything other than the short-term evolution of this species, a bifurcating treelike phylogeny is not an appropriate model.},

By using two selectable markers, i.e., temperature sensitivity and monoclonal antibody neutralization, we isolated several recombinant viruses from the brains of mice infected with two different strains of {MHV}. The recombination frequency was very high, and recombination occurred at multiple sites on the viral {RNA} genome.

Many tree-based methods for sequence analysis, for example, those used for detecting sites evolving nonneutrally, have been shown to fail if such phylogenetic incongruity is ignored. However, it may be possible to propose several phylogenies that can correctly model the evolution of nonrecombinant fragments. We propose a model-based framework that uses a genetic algorithm to search a multiple-sequence alignment for putative recombination break points, quantifies the level of support for their locations, and identifies sequences or clades involved in putative recombination events. The software implementation can be run quickly and efficiently in a distributed computing environment, and various components of the methods can be chosen for computational expediency or statistical rigor. We evaluate the performance of the new method on simulated alignments and on an array of published benchmark data sets. Finally, we demonstrate that prescreening alignments with our method allows one to analyze recombinant sequences for positive selection.},

	Abstract = {Embryonated eggs were coinfected with two strains of the coronavirus avian infectious bronchitis virus ({IBV}), {IBV}-Beaudette and {IBV}-M41, to investigate whether recombination between the two strains would occur. Virions were isolated from the allantoic fluid of the coinfected eggs and putative hybrid {RNAs} were detected by polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}), using strain-specific oligonucleotides. {PCR} products, of the expected sizes, were obtained as predicted from potential recombination events between the nucleoprotein (N) gene and the 3′-untranslated region of the two {IBV} genomes. Sequencing confirmed that they corresponded to hybrid {RNAs}. Virus produced as a result of the mixed infection was treated with an M41-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody and passaged in Vero cells, in which {IBV}-Beaudette, but not {IBV}-M41, replicated. Hybrid {RNA} was still detectable after three serial passages. Since no {IBV}-M41 was detectable this confirmed that infectious recombinant genomes had been produced in the embryonated eggs. These findings not only support the circumstantial evidence, from sequencing studies of {IBV} field strains, that recombination occurs during replication of {IBV} and contributes to the diversity of {IBV}, but also show that coronavirus {RNA} recombination is not limited to mouse hepatitis virus.},

@article{lai_1985,
	Abstract = {We have isolated a recombinant virus between the A59 and {JHM} strains of mouse hepatitis virus, which contain a single species of nonsegmented {RNA} genome. This recombinant was derived by mixed infection of {DBT} cells with temperature-sensitive mutants of A59 and {JHM} at nonpermissive temperature. Viruses recovered at this temperature were screened by oligonucleotide fingerprinting of their genomic {RNAs}. One recombinant virus, B1, was found to contain mostly A59-derived sequences, but the 3 kilobases at the 5' end of the genomic {RNA} was derived from {JHM}. Thus, the crossover point in the B1 genome is located within gene A, which codes for the viral {RNA} polymerases. The study of the intracellular {RNA} species of B1 virus revealed that probably all of the virus-specific subgenomic {mRNA} species contained the body sequences of strain A59 but the leader sequences of {JHM}. This result indicates that the {JHM} leader {RNA}, which differs from the A59 leader {RNA}, could be fused to the {mRNAs} of a different virus strain during {RNA} transcription. Furthermore, B1 virus-infected cells contain an additional subgenomic {mRNA} species which is transcribed from a new initiation site within gene C, suggesting that the leader {RNA} could determine the site of initiation for coronavirus {mRNAs}. These data represent a first report of {RNA} recombination between viruses, other than picornaviruses, which contain nonsegmented {RNA} genomes.},

@article{makino_1986,
	Abstract = {The {RNA} genome of coronaviruses consists of a single species of nonsegmented {RNA}. In this communication, we demonstrate that the {RNA} genomes of different strains of murine coronaviruses recombine during mixed infection at a very high frequency. Susceptible cells were coinfected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of one strain of mouse hepatitis virus ({MHV}) and a wild-type virus of a different strain. Of 21 randomly isolated viruses released from the coinfected cells at the nonpermissive temperature, 2 were recombinants which differed in the site of recombination. After three serial passages of the original virus pool derived from the mixed infection, the majority of the progeny viruses were recombinants. These recombinant viruses represented at least five different recombination sites between the two parental {MHV} strains. Such a high-frequency recombination between nonsegmented {RNA} genomes of {MHV} suggests that segmented {RNA} intermediates might be generated during {MHV} replication. We propose that the {RNA} replication of {MHV} proceeds in a discontinuous and nonprocessive manner, thus generating free segmented {RNA} intermediates, which could be used in {RNA} recombination via a copy-choice mechanism.},

	Abstract = {Determining the amount of recombination in the genealogical history of a sample of genes is important to both evolutionary biology and medical population genetics. However, recurrent mutation can produce patterns of genetic diversity similar to those generated by recombination and can bias estimates of the population recombination rate. Hudson (2001) has suggested an approximate-likelihood method based on coalescent theory to estimate the population recombination rate, 4Ner, under an infinite-sites model of sequence evolution. Here we extend the method to the estimation of the recombination rate in genomes, such as those of many viruses and bacteria, where the rate of recurrent mutation is high. In addition, we develop a powerful permutation-based method for detecting recombination that is both more powerful than other permutation-based methods and robust to misspecification of the model of sequence evolution. We apply the method to sequence data from viruses, bacteria, and human mitochondrial {DNA}. The extremely high level of recombination detected in both {HIV}1 and {HIV}2 sequences demonstrates that recombination cannot be ignored in the analysis of viral population genetic data.},

	Abstract = {Recombination is a key evolutionary process that shapes the architecture of genomes and the genetic structure of populations. Although many statistical methods are available for the detection of recombination from {DNA} sequences, their absolute and relative performance is still unknown. Here we evaluated the performance of 14 different recombination detection algorithms. We used the coalescent with recombination to simulate {DNA} sequences with different levels of recombination, genetic diversity, and rate variation among sites. Recombination detection methods were applied to these data sets, and whether they detected or not recombination was recorded. Different recombination methods showed distinct performance depending on the amount of recombination, genetic diversity, and rate variation among sites. The model of nucleotide substitution under which the data were generated did not seem to have a significant effect. Most methods increase power with more sequence divergence. In general, recombination detection methods seem to capture the presence of recombination, but they are not very powerful. Methods that use substitution patterns or incompatibility among sites were more powerful than methods based on phylogenetic incongruence. Most methods do not seem to infer more false positives than expected by chance. Especially depending on the amount of diversity in the data, different methods could be used to attain maximum power while minimizing false positives. Results shown here will provide some guidance in the selection of the most appropriate method/s for the analysis of the particular data at hand.},

@article{reusken_2013,
	Abstract = {{SummaryBackground}
A new betacoronavirus---Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV})---has been identified in patients with severe acute respiratory infection. Although related viruses infect bats, molecular clock analyses have been unable to identify direct ancestors of {MERS}-{CoV}. Anecdotal exposure histories suggest that patients had been in contact with dromedary camels or goats. We investigated possible animal reservoirs of {MERS}-{CoV} by assessing specific serum antibodies in livestock.
Methods
We took sera from animals in the Middle East (Oman) and from elsewhere (Spain, Netherlands, Chile). Cattle (n=80), sheep (n=40), goats (n=40), dromedary camels (n=155), and various other camelid species (n=34) were tested for specific serum {IgG} by protein microarray using the receptor-binding S1 subunits of spike proteins of {MERS}-{CoV}, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and human coronavirus {OC}43. Results were confirmed by virus neutralisation tests for {MERS}-{CoV} and bovine coronavirus.
Findings
50 of 50 (100\%) sera from Omani camels and 15 of 105 (14\%) from Spanish camels had protein-specific antibodies against {MERS}-{CoV} spike. Sera from European sheep, goats, cattle, and other camelids had no such antibodies. {MERS}-{CoV} neutralising antibody titres varied between 1/320 and 1/2560 for the Omani camel sera and between 1/20 and 1/320 for the Spanish camel sera. There was no evidence for cross-neutralisation by bovine coronavirus antibodies.
Interpretation
{MERS}-{CoV} or a related virus has infected camel populations. Both titres and seroprevalences in sera from different locations in Oman suggest widespread infection.

	Abstract = {In this article, a method is proposed for detecting recombination in the sequences of a gene from a set of closely related organisms. The method, the Homoplasy Test, is appropriate when the sequences are rather similar, differing by 1\%-5\% of nucleotides. It is effective in detecting relatively frequent recombination between a set of rather similar strains, in contrast to previous methods which detect rare or unique transfers between more distant strains. It is based on the fact that, if there is no recombination and if no repeated mutations have occurred (homoplasy), then the number of polymorphic sites, v, is equal to the number of steps, t, in a most-parsimonious tree. If the number of "apparent homoplasies" in the most-parsimonious tree, h = t-v, is greater than zero, then either homoplasies have occurred by mutation or there has been recombination. An estimate of the distribution of h expected on the null hypothesis of no recombination depends on Se, the "effective site number," defined as follows: if ps is the probability that two independent substitutions in the gene occur at the same site, then Se = 1/ps. Se can be estimated if a suitable outgroup is available. The Homoplasy Test is applied to three bacterial genes and to simulated gene trees with varying amounts of recombination. Methods of estimating the rate, as opposed to the occurrence, of recombination are discussed.},
